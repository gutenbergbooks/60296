<h3>
Foreword
</h3>

<p>
Pte. Clarke of the Orderly Room staff told
me how my coming as Chaplain to the 43rd
in 1917 was announced to the men attached to
Battalion Headquarters.  They were "killing
time" off duty in one of the cellars under the
brick-piles on the flats facing Avion.  I give it
in his own words as well as memory recalls them.
</p>

<p>
"We knew," he said, "that D. T. Macpherson
had some news by the hurried way he slithered
down the muddy dug-out steps.  He came with
bent head over to the candle-light where a bunch
of us were resting after a few hours "running"
and "mending wire" with explosive hardware
dropping around us.  'Well,' said Mac, when he
got over near us, 'I've got a new job and it's a
cushy one.  No more listening-post for me or
walking around in a front-line trench asking
for a blighty.  Nay, nay!  The new chaplain has
arrived and I'm his batman.  After this I'll have
to work only one day a week.  On Sundays I'll
pass around the hymn-books, lead the singing,
and see that none of you fellows miss church
parade.'  'You'll last about two weeks, Mac,'
said Jesse Elder.  'The chaplain will have to
get rid of you if he wants to make good.
Otherwise you'd handicap him, corrupt him and kill
his influence.  But what's his name and where
is he from?'  'His name is Pringle,
Capt. George Pringle.  I heard him tell the O.C. that
he had spent years in the Klondike Goldfields
in early days.'  'Well,' Elder replied, 'that
sounds good.  He ought to be able to give us
some Rex Beach-Jack London stuff.  See what
sort he is, Mac, and when you get better
acquainted sound him about coming under-ground
here to give us some stories of the North.'  The
proposition sounded all right and Macpherson
said he'd try for it."
</p>

<p>
When Mac put the request to me I welcomed
the chance it gave me to talk to ready listeners
about a land I love, to me the fairest under
heaven.  The men were always eager to listen,
eager because the stories were about Canada and
they were home-sick.  Also because in every
man there is something that stirs responsive to
tales of the mystic Northland, vast, white, and
silent.  Then besides, the mad years of the Great
Stampede had their own appeal, when the
golden treasures were found and adventurers from
the Seven Seas rushed to the discovery.  What
days those were, filled with tragedy and comedy,
shameful things we would fain forget but can't,
incidents too of heroism and comradeship that
will live in our memories forever, and through
it all, bad and good, an intense, throbbing life
that was irresistibly fascinating.  Little wonder
that my soldiers, out themselves on a great
adventure, would listen to stories of the Yukon
and its adventurers in those glorious Stampede
days.
</p>

<p>
Many an hour have I spent with my men off
duty spinning these "sourdough" yarns, and I
know very often we forgot for the time the
dugout and the trench, hardly hearing the boom of
the guns or bursting shells.
</p>

<p>
The incidents are true both in prologue and
story.  In "The Lost Patrol" and "Soapy Smith"
I am indebted to my good friends Staff-Sergt. Joy
of the R.N.W.M.P. and Mr. D. C. Stephens
of Vananda, for inside information not
otherwise obtainable.  Mr. George P. Mackenzie,
Gold Commissioner for the Yukon, has given
me data I needed from government records.  I
am very grateful to my former "O.C.,"
Lieut.-Colonel H. M. Urquhart, M.C., D.S.O., now
commanding the 1st Battalion Canadian Scottish,
for arduous work done by him in getting my
manuscript into shape.  The preparation of
these sketches, as they now stand, came about
largely through the kindly encouragement and
expert advice of Dr. Haddow of the <i>Presbyterian
Witness</i> in which journal some of them
were published.
</p>

<p>
The stories are put down pretty much as I
told them.  I have had, of course, to make some
changes to suit a written narrative offered to a
larger circle.  The language and style are
homely, for the stories were first given in simple
words and I have tried to reproduce them.
Some names have been changed for obvious
reasons.  Probably I seem at times to speak
much about myself; where this happens I
couldn't avoid it in telling my story.  For the
rest I make no excuse.  There is one advantage
about a book, if you don't like it you can shut
it up!
</p>

<p>
If these pages serve to keep alive old
friendships and pleasant memories among my
"tillicums" of the trail, and the men in khaki to whom
I ministered, I shall be content.

<i>The Fan-Tail Trail</i>
</h3>

<p>
A night in June 1917 found me under
one of the brick-piles on the Avion front
in a safe little cellar that the Hun had fixed up
for himself and then turned over to us.  I was
seated on some sand-bags set against the wall,
with a "capacity house" to hear a Klondike
tale.  A few candles gave a dim light hazy with
thick tobacco smoke, making it easier for fancy
to have free course.  There were no interruptions
except the occasional call from the top of
the dug-out stairs for some man to report for
duty.  The sound of shells and guns came dully
to our ears and seemed unheard as, in imagination,
we travelled afar to fairer climes and by-gone days.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you to-night of my first trip to the
North and my first attempt to travel with a
dog-team on a winter trail.
</p>

<p>
In 1899 I was a Missionary in the back-woods
of Minnesota learning to preach, practising on
our American cousins out of consideration for
the feelings of my fellow-Canadians!  I was
quite contented in my work, preaching at little
country schoolhouses with long distances to
drive between, but getting everywhere the best
they had of hospitality.
</p>

<p>
One day in the winter of 1899-1900 a telegram
came to me from Dr. Robertson our Canadian
Superintendent of Missions asking me, if
agreeable, to report at Winnipeg that week for duty
in the Yukon.  I couldn't resist "the call of the
wild" and I wired acceptance of the appointment.
Two weeks later I was on the C.P.R. headed
for Vancouver.  There I got a berth on a
little steamboat named the <i>Cutch</i>, bound for
Skagway, Alaska, the great gateway to the
"Golden North."
</p>

<p>
I'll not easily forget that trip.  The boat was
crowded beyond what seemed possible.  Every
berth was twice taken, one man sleeping at night
the other in the daytime.  The floors of the
cabins were occupied as berths night and day.
They slept under the tables and on them and in
the gangways and on the decks.  Meals were
"on" all day in order to get everyone served.
There were some wild times aboard and plenty
of discomfort, but the greatest good-feeling
generally prevailed for the boat was headed
north and every hour brought them nearer to
the land where fortunes were made in a day.
Amazing stories, and all the more amazing
because they were true, had come south telling of
the richness of the new gold-fields.  Gold-dust
and nuggets lay scattered apparently without
known limit in the gravels and schist of the
creeks.  It was a "poor man's diggings" too.  A
stout back, a pick, a pan, a shovel and a little
"grub" were all you needed.  After two or three
days' work it might be your luck to strike the
pay-streak and have your secret dreams of
sudden wealth come true.  Why not you as well as
those other fellows?  There was Lippi who had
already cleaned up a million out of a part of
his 250 feet on Eldorado, Macdonald "the
Klondike King," otherwise, "Big Alec the Moose,"
who had been offered in London five million
for his interests, Dick Lowe who owned a
50-foot "fraction" on Bonanza that some said had
almost as much gold as dirt in it.  Johannsen
and Anderson, the "Lucky Swedes" and "Skiff"
Mitchell who worked No. 1 on Eldorado.  These
all had been poor men and there were hundreds
of others that had done nearly as well.  Besides,
the claims were mostly just being opened up and
nobody really knew what more marvellous finds
might yet be made.  Aboard the boat were all
sorts of men from all parts of the world but
all alike were filled with high hopes.  Keen they
were to try their luck in this big gamble where
such alluring prizes were going to fortune's
favorites.  So nobody was looking for trouble.
They had no lasting grievance against anyone
who didn't interfere with their one great object
of getting to Dawson.  The only growling was
at the slow progress the boat made, but an "ocean
greyhound" would not have been fast enough
to satisfy their eager haste.
</p>

<p>
It was a glorious trip in spite of all we had to
put up with.  Most of us were seeing for the
first time the beautiful scenery of the western
Canadian coast.  Our boat sailed straight north
for a thousand miles in the Pacific yet with land
always close in on both sides.  It is the most
magnificent combination of ocean and mountain
scenery in the world.  It is more majestic than
the fiords of Norway, nor can the Inland Sea
of Japan have anything more lovely, and here
there is a full thousand miles of it.  The ocean
has inundated a great mountain range.  For
days we sailed through winding channels broad
and narrow, and among giant mountain peaks
that dwarfed our boat.  Sometimes the trees
came right down to the water's edge, or we
steamed between precipitous cliffs where the
tide-rip ran like a mighty stream.  As we got
further north glaciers glistened within rifle-shot
and we could see plenty of little ice-bergs around
us that had toppled off into the water.  It was
mountain-climbing by steam-boat!
</p>

<p>
Our voyage ended at Skagway, a typical
"tough" frontier town that boasted the last and
worst "gun-man" of the west, Soapy Smith.
But that is "another story."  I spent a night
there and then took the narrow-gauge railway
over the White Pass to Log-Cabin, where I left
the train.  From Log-Cabin, a lonely-looking,
huddled-together group of a dozen small log
buildings, I was to start on my first trip on a
Northern trail in mid-winter.  The Fan-tail
Trail it was called, running over these
wind-swept summits seventy-five miles to Atlin on
Atlin Lake, one of the great lakes that feed the
Yukon river.  I was to go with a dog-driver or
"musher" named Stewart who had been
commissioned to bring in the new Sky Pilot "dead
or alive."  It was afternoon before I reached
Log-Cabin but Stewart decided not to wait
until next day but to start right away.  He wanted
to make it over the summit, eighteen miles, to
the Tepee, the first roadhouse on the trail, and
there put up for the night.  This would break
the journey and enable us to do the rest of the
trip to Atlin&mdash;sixty miles, before nightfall the
next day.  It all sounded vague to me, seemed
indeed a very big proposition, but I agreed,
being green and not wishing to display my
ignorance by discussing it.  Moreover I was young
and ready to tackle anything.  Stewart was
experienced, knew the trail, and was as hard as
nails.  He had a team of six dogs hitched tandem
to a sleigh about eight feet long and two feet
wide on which he had lashed a high built load of
freight.  I trotted along bravely enough after
Stewart and his dogs and for a few miles held
my own, but when we got out into the drifts
I commenced to lag.  He tried me sitting on
top of the load but that made it top-heavy and
we had several upsets.  Twice we had to unlash
the load, get the sleigh up on the trail again
and reload, all the time working in snow up to
our waists.  It showed that plan worse than
useless.  Then he suggested that I try if I could
guide the sleigh holding the handles, like
plough-handles, that projected behind.  To hold
these gave me help and it would have been fine
if I had been able to keep the sleigh on the trail,
but that is learned only by long practice.
</p>

<p>
After several bad mishaps I had to give that
up.  Then Stewart told me to go ahead on the
trail and make the pace according to my
strength.  But that wouldn't work either, for,
in the drifts my feet could not find or keep the
trail, and the dogs following me were continually
getting into tangles in the deep snow.
There was nothing for me but to follow as best
I could.  When within five miles of the Tepee
we left the wind-swept plateaus and entered a
forest.  There the trail slanted down to the gulch
where our night's journey was to end.  Among
the trees there were no drifts and while it was
easier going for me so it was for the dogs.  They
knew well enough where they were, that there
was rest and dinner for them at the end of that
five miles, and nothing could hold them.  I was
pretty well "all in" but I struggled on trying to
keep up until a sort of partial unconsciousness
came over me.  I seemed to see only the two
moccasined heels of the musher ever disappearing
before me.  All I seemed to know at last was
to keep my eye on them as they slipped away,
away, ever away, from me into the darkness.
Stewart could hear me coming and of course
didn't appreciate the situation.  I hadn't
trail-sense enough to tell him to go on and I would
follow slowly for now the trail was comparatively
easy.  I heard the timber wolves howling but
there was no danger from them that winter as
long as I kept going.  I know this now, but I was
a "tenderfoot" then.  Stewart knew my brother
John as the best musher on the Teslin trail and
thought, no doubt, that I'd be able to stick it
without trouble.  When we got near enough
to hear the dogs at the roadhouse howling, ours
quickened their pace and I was left hopelessly in
the rear.  I grew faint and sick with my efforts,
staggering along, running into the trees and off
the trail, to crawl back again and go a few yards
on hands and knees.  At last, stumbling like a
drunken man, I ran into the roadhouse yard and
right into my brother's arms!  He had reached
the Tepee that night on his way out from Atlin
to Log-Cabin.  I could eat no supper, slept not
a wink all night, for every nerve and muscle in
my body seemed on fire, nor could I touch
breakfast, except a cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
As long as I live I shall never forget my first
hours on the trail.  Even now I can close my
eyes and see again those moccasined heels
slipping away from me into the snow-white
darkness and feel again something of the sick
exhaustion of those last few gruelling miles.
</p>

<p>
In the morning our teams lined up again.  My
brother headed for Log-Cabin, thence
Vancouver, then Eastern Canada and home.  I to
travel wearily on for another day towards a
mining camp with all its unknown problems for
me as a green missionary.  I was homesick,
anxious, and physically felt almost useless.
Maybe I had some unshed tears in my eyes as
we stood together a moment before saying
good-bye, for John said, "Well, George, you're just
at the present moment the 'wateriest-looking'
preacher I think I've ever seen."  It was "good
medicine" for it made us all laugh and so we
parted.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the trip was luckily easy for me.
Stewart had left part of his load at the Tepee
and I was able to ride on the sleigh whenever I
wished.  By noon my appetite asserted itself
with redoubled force.  We stopped at the
Half-Way House and had a satisfying dinner.  By
the time we came within sight of Atlin, across
the five miles of frozen lake, the clouds had
cleared away and I felt the zest for adventure
and love for my work, that had brought me
north, coming into their own again.
</p>

<p>
It was a week before I got the stiffness of that
run over the "Fan-Tail" out of my muscles.  My
memory will ever hold a clear-cut and painful
recollection of it.

<i>II</i>
<br /><br />
<i>Down the Yukon on a Scow</i>
</h3>

<p>
Sains-en-Gohelle is a neat little mining
town not far from Lens where the Canadian
Camerons on several occasions put in their
short "rest" periods after their turn in the
trenches.
</p>

<p>
I remember the place more distinctly because
it was there I first donned the kilts.  The
Quartermaster, Medical Officer, and Chaplain were
attached to the battalion for rations and duty
only, and on such matters as uniform were not
under the authority of the battalion commander.
So I had never changed from the usual khaki
dress.  But our new O.C., Lt.-Col. Urquhart,
was keen to have us all in kilts so that on parade
we three would not look, as he put it, "like stray
sheep."  The M.O. and the Q.M. (both named
MacKenzie) were willing enough.  They were
stout built fellows.  I hesitated.  I am of the
grey-hound type, built for speed not beauty, and
feared that I would look a spectacle in kilts.
Indeed, I was apparently not alone in my opinion
for Major Tommie Taylor advised me if I put
them on not to go out too much when it was
getting dusk.  "The police might arrest you,
padre," he said, "for not having any visible
means of support."

<p>
The O.C's wishes prevailed at last and
Macpherson and I went over to see Henderson, the
regimental tailor.  We picked out a good kilt
from the stores, my measurements were taken
and next day I had a try on.  It took quite a
while before everything was right and I was
ready for the road.  I walked down the little
village street that first time in kilts with
something the same unpleasantly self-conscious
feeling you have when in a dream you find yourself
in a front seat at some public gathering with only
pyjamas on.  I saw two French peasant girls
coming.  I blushed all over and felt like "taking
to the tall timber."  But I faced the music with
a fearfully conscious bravado.  My fears and
self-conceit fell in ruins together for they never
gave me so much as a glance as we passed.  Of
course I might have known that "kilties" were
a common sight to them and that they had seen
many better legs than mine!
</p>

<p>
At dinner I had Colonel Urquhart look me
over and he decided I was first-class (said so,
anyway!), a little white about the knees but the
sun would mend that.  I soon felt quite at home
in the kilt on parade and off it, and in the six
months I wore them nothing happened to justify
Tommie Taylor's warning.
</p>

<p>
I recollect that one day during a "rest" I
happened in to one of the huts where they were
discussing for the "nth" time the famous naval
battle of Jutland fought the year before.
Someone had picked up an old newspaper, a <i>Sunday
Observer</i>, giving a critical account of the whole
engagement, and they were talking it over again.
All were agreed that it was a real victory for our
Navy, for while the action was costly and the
German fleet was not destroyed, yet the glorious
fact remained that the Huns had had to "beat"
it.  We patted our Navy on the back again in
several different styles and gloated over the
return of the enemy's fleet to its compulsory
hermitage at Kiel.  Then someone started to talk
about the relative merits of land and sea fighting
from the standpoint of discomfort and danger
to the fighting man.  "Smiler" McDermid was
all for the Navy.  "Those big battleships are
just floating fortified hotels," he said.  "Every
man has his own bunk, blankets warm and dry,
regular hours, good grub, and no pack to carry.
They don't average a fight a year and then the
scrap is over one way or the other in an hour or
two.  Besides they're always getting in to port
to coal up or be dry-docked and then there is
shore-leave every night in dear old Blighty.  No
long marches, no mud, no trenches, dirt or
vermin.  Give me the Navy for a cushy job
every time."  "Shorty" Montgomery didn't
think it would be as good as it sounded&mdash;"You
would get fed up with the ship after a few
months.  It would be your prison for weeks at a
time.  There would be nothing to look at but
the ocean, nowhere to go but walk around your
own limited quarters.  On the other hand, we
are constantly moving from one front to another
and in and out of the line and seeing new towns
and villages.  It's a sort of free Government tour
through France and Flanders.  Our life,
although hard, is not so monotonous nor the
discipline so strict as it must be in the Navy.  In a
scrap, if the ship goes down, you go with it,
while on land you have a fighting chance to save
your own life anyway."
</p>

<p>
Others had gathered in and took part.  Preferences
were pretty evenly divided, the general
opinion being that it would be more comfortable
to live on board a battleship but more agreeable
to do our fighting on land.  The talk drifted to
personal experiences on ships and when I said
that I had once been "a sailor before the mast"
on the Yukon "the fat was in the fire," and it was
up to me to tell this story of my first trip on a
scow four hundred miles down the Yukon River
to Dawson.  Before I started Clarke asked me to
wait a few minutes till he rounded up the
fellows in the other huts.  When I began our hut
was full.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
I had been nine months in the Atlin Gold
Camp at the head waters of the Yukon and had
gone out in the fall of 1900 to Kingston, where
I spent the winter.  Next spring the
command-request came from Dr. Robertson to go to the
Yukon again, this time to the Creeks back of
Dawson City.  I had got a taste of the North in
Atlin and I was eager to go.  I followed the
usual route from Vancouver to Skagway, then
over the Pass to White Horse, a relay camp just
below the rapids.
</p>

<p>
It was early in June, but the ice was not yet
out of Lake Lebarge, an expansion of the river
some miles below White Horse.  I had to wait
ten days before it was clear.  This forced stay
used up my funds so that I couldn't pay steamboat
fare.  The only other method practicable
for me was to work my way down to Dawson by
getting a job as one of the "sweep-men" on a
scow.  I heard that Mike King had three
twenty-ton scows ready to load and was looking
for a crew, so I applied and was taken on as an
"able-bodied seaman."  There were eighteen of
us in all, including the cook who was a southern
darky.  We were a queer mixture.  You didn't
ask too many questions of chance acquaintances
in those days but I know that in our crew there
was a doctor, a gambler, a sky-pilot, a Mormon,
and a carpenter or two.  The others I couldn't
figure out.  My profession wasn't known at first
for I wore no clerical uniform.  Sweater, rough
pants, and heavy boots served my turn, and the
others were dressed much the same.  Each of
us had to sign an agreement not to mutiny against
the pilot, to obey his orders, and to accept fifteen
dollars at Dawson, with our food on the way, as
full payment for all we might have to do,
loading, unloading, and on the river.  First we had
to get our cargo aboard, baled hay and sacks of
oats, sixty tons in all, so the first work I did in
the Yukon was longshoring.
</p>

<p>
We were ready to go about ten in the morning
and shoved out into the current.  We had no
self-propelling power, simply floated with the
stream using "sweeps" to keep in the main
channel.  These "sweeps" were about fourteen
feet long, heavy, roughly-shaped oars, two at
bow and stern of each scow.  We stood up to
work them at the command of our pilot.  He
was a good river-man from Ottawa, and I can
hear him yet singing out his orders as he looked
ahead and with practiced eye noted shoals or
eddies that we could not see, or if we saw, did
not know their meaning.  It was "Hit her to
starboard forrard," "Starboard all," "Port all,"
and "Steady all," when we got into good water
again.  We made a good get-away and soon were
floating swiftly and silently onward in
mid-stream.  This great river, five hundred yards
wide twelve hundred miles from its mouth, was
brimful from the spring thaw and the three big,
heavily-laden scows lashed side by side were
carried along like a feather.  You could feel the
rhythmic surge and heave of the mighty flood
almost as if the swell of some far-off ocean storm
had crept up-stream to us.  So in very truth a
great river has a throb of life in it, a pulse
beat in unison with the deep life of the Universe.
</p>

<p>
We didn't need to tie up at night because of
darkness.  There is no darkness there in June
and you could hear the singing all night long of
innumerable birds among the trees on either
bank and see them flying about.  I wonder when
they slept!  On the scows we had an easy task.
It wasn't constant work.  After getting safely
past some shoal or rocks we would pull our
sweeps in and lie down beside them for sleep or
rest until aroused by the captain's voice.  When
we tied up to the bank it was usually that all
hands might be assured of a right good sleep and
not because of darkness or exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
By morning we had reached Lake Lebarge
and were towed across to the outlet where our
scows were soon again in the grip of the river.
This part was called "Thirty-Mile," a rough,
rapid, winding stretch, dangerous even to
steamboats, demanding skill and vigilance.  Our pilot
took a long chance in risking the three scows
abreast.  We nearly made it, but, when there
was only another ten miles to go and travelling
at a tremendous pace, he gave the order to "put
her to starboard all" at one of the curves a trifle
too late.  We all saw the danger, a jagged bank
angling into the stream, and put every ounce we
had in us on the sweeps.  It was in vain.  The
port scow crashed against the rocks.  We held for
a few minutes, barely time to get a line ashore
and round a tree when the current caught us
again and commenced to swing us out into
mid-stream.  The tree bent, held a moment, and then
came tearing out by the roots.  Things were
looking bad.  Two sweeps were broken and we
were circling round with the broken scow filling
fast.  We had to try for another landing or it
would mean a complete wreck, with loss of the
cargo and some of the crew as well.  The next
ten minutes were extremely interesting, to put
it mildly, but fortune favoured us in the shape
of a back eddy, these strange currents that circle
up-stream near shore.  We worked furiously
towards it and at last made it although
the momentum of the almost unmanageable
scows crashed us again on the rocks, there was no
strong current to drag us off.  We got a line
ashore to a good stout tree and so made fast.
</p>

<p>
The injured scow was settling and the only
thing to do was to unload it as quickly as
possible, and then seek to repair the damage done.
Otherwise the owners stood to lose heavily with
hay and oats selling at one hundred and
twenty-five dollars a ton.  We had a strenuous time
emptying that scow.  First the twenty ton of
fodder had to be taken out a bale and a sack at
a time, averaging dry over one hundred pounds
each, and every minute getting wet and wetter.
They had to be carried on our shoulders across
a rickety make-shift gang-plank of sweeps to the
rock shore and there stacked up somehow.  Next
we rigged up a Spanish windlass and dragged
one corner of the scow into the shallows and
worked up to our knees in ice-cold water at what
seemed an endless task of baling.  At last, with
baling and the pull of our windlass, we got the
broken part clear so that it could be mended.
</p>

<p>
Only two or three could work handily at that
job so after a rest several of us climbed the bank
and went into the woods to explore.  There were
evidently miles of good spruce timber on
extensive mesas running back to the low rolling
mountains.  The ground was sprinkled with
flowers among the blueberry and cranberry
bushes and we found several clusters of very
pretty wild orchids.  But what surprised us
most was to literally walk into numerous coveys
of willow grouse.  They were so unafraid that
we easily knocked over a good score of them
with sticks.  When we got to the scows with
our "poultry" our story of the tame grouse
would hardly have been believed if we hadn't
been able "to deliver the goods."  When Sambo,
our cook, saw us, his eyes rolled and all his
ivories were displayed in a full-sized grin of
welcome, and we surely did have a feast of fried
grouse next day in which "all hands and the
cook" took leading parts.
</p>

<p>
During our absence one of the carpenters was
nearly drowned.  We noticed when we returned
that his face was scratched and that it had an
unusual thoughtful expression.  In examining
the extent of the damage from the inside of the
scow, to get a better look he poked his head down
the splintered hole, lost his balance and slipped
through to his waist, with his head under water
and unable to move further in or out or to shout
for help.  He would soon have drowned had
not someone happened to notice the frantic
waving of his feet in the air.  One of them said
they had seen dumb men talking with their
hands but they had never seen any man make
such an eloquent speech with his feet.  When he
was got out he had imbibed about all the Yukon
river he could accommodate.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't long, once the scow was made water-tight,
before we had it reloaded and were on our
way again.  After we passed the mouth of
the Hootalinqua (Indian for "Home of the
Moose") we had very little work to do.  The
river was so straight, broad, and full that our
pilot simply kept mid-stream and had no trouble.
Shooting Five Finger Rapids was exciting but
not specially dangerous at high water if you
knew the right channel.  We swept through into
smooth water in fine style.  The men for'ard
were soaked with spray but they soon dried out
in the plentiful sunshine pouring down on us
from a cloudless sky.
</p>

<p>
Before noon on the third day we came in sight
of the white-scarred mountain-dome at the foot
of which, unseen by us yet, was the famous
Mecca of Gold-hunters, Dawson City.  In an
hour or two we were floating round the cliff in
bad water where the Klondike river rushes into
the Yukon.  A few minutes of hard work to keep
our course and not be carried away over to the
far shore and then we were through and everyone
was pulling to edge in close to the right bank
where our journey was to end.  Now we could
lift our heads and pause to look ashore and see
this mushroom city of cabins and tents, and the
outlines of the hills and valleys behind it where
fortunes were hidden for the lucky ones.  At last
we found a place to tie up about four scows out
from land.  There were dozens of scows and
hundreds of boats and rafts of every shape and
sort, and the whole place, waterfront and streets,
stores and cabins, swarming with men night and
day.  We got in about noon, had our dinner and
then wandered about in the crowds sight-seeing.
</p>

<p>
After supper we started to unload and worked
all night at it.  About midnight we knocked off
for an hour, had a bite to eat, and then went over
by the invitation of the owner of the cargo, a
Dawson man, to have drink at one of the many
waterfront saloons.  I was young, inexperienced,
and didn't want to go at all but "the bunch"
wouldn't leave me behind.  So I went.  We all
lined up at the bar and were asked in turn what
we'd have.  It was "whisky" all down the line
till it came to my turn and I confess to a strong
desire to be "one of the boys" and say the same.
It was, I think, a "toss-up" what my decision
would be, but somehow I managed to say in a
timid, apologetic voice, "lemonade!"  I had an
idea that they would jeer at me, for my order had
to my ears, in those circumstances, a very
effeminate sound.  I was surprised to hear one or two
others after me follow my lead and I didn't feel
so much "out of it."
</p>

<p>
Six months afterwards I received a letter from
a fellow I'd got chummy with on the scows.  His
name was Dolan.  He was young and fair-haired
and I remember we nick-named him
"The Yellow Kid."  He had gone on down to
Mastodon Gulch and had struck fair pay there.
I quote from his letter, which I still have after
these twenty years.  "Some rich pay has been
found here and the usual camp has sprung up
with road-houses and 'red-lights'.  All night it
surely is 'hell let loose'.  I've cut out the
'hootch'.  It was getting me at White Horse.  Your call
for lemonade at Dawson that night we landed
showed me that a fellow can be in with the boys
and yet not drink."  This sounds to some of you
perhaps a little "fishy," or like a conventional
Sunday School yarn.  But, honest, that is just
as it happened and Dolan hadn't the faintest
resemblance to a "sissy."  It simply showed me
that the laws of influence work on the frontier
the same as elsewhere and that a man doesn't
need to haul down the flag of self-respect or
principle to get into the right kind of good
fellowship.  I needed just that lesson to put
backbone into me for the days of fierce temptation
that were immediately before me.
</p>

<p>
We went back and finished our job as
longshoremen, lined up for our fifteen dollars and
parted with handshakes and sincere good wishes
all round.  I hunted up Dr. Grant's cabin and
there got a right royal welcome.  We breakfasted
together and then I rolled in to one of his
bunks for a sleep and heard nothing more until
I was roused for dinner.

<i>III.</i>
<br /><br />
<i>A Klondike Christmas Dinner</i>
</h3>

<p>
All Canadian soldiers who got to France
will remember what we called "the hospital"
at St. Pierre in front of Lens.  This
"hospital" wasn't a hospital as we understand the
word.  It had been a pretentious Roman Catholic
children's school.  Now it was a massive ruin,
a great heap of bricks, mortar, splintered beams
and broken tiling, with parts of the stout walls
here and there left standing.  It became the
customary battalion headquarters on that section
of the Lens front.  It was only 300 yards away
from No Man's Land and so was convenient
as a centre for directing operations.  In the
ruins a cellar-door had been discovered by
which entrance was obtained to a vaulted brick
tunnel running underground the whole length
of the building crossed by another at right
angles.  Further exploration had found three
small rooms above on the ground floor that could
be used.  They were covered by such a depth
of rubble that they were practically secure from
ordinary shell-fire.  The O.C. and officers took
up their quarters in these rooms while the men
attached occupied the tunnels.  It was dry there
and warm, altho, dark and too low to permit
one to stand erect.  This last was of little
importance for our usual attitude when off duty was
a recumbent one!  Altogether it was one of the
most comfortable "forward" headquarters I
have ever been in.
</p>

<p>
It happened that on Christmas Day, 1917 the
43rd and 116th were holding the line on the 9th
Brigade front.  The 116th had established its
orderly-room in a cellar under a ruined brick
house not far from the hospital.  I chanced to
drop in about noon.  They made me stay for
Christmas Dinner.  The hospitality and good
fellowship were perfect.  The dinner was a
feast.  We had soup, roast turkey with all the
fixings, vegetables, pie and pudding, tea and
cake.  We were crowded closely but there was
room to work our "sword-arms."  The turkey
had been roasted and the whole dinner prepared
in a corner of the cellar-stairs by one of the men.
How he managed to serve such a delicious hot
dinner is beyond me.  These men that did the
cooking in the line for the different groups of
officers were most of them simply
miracle-workers.  They were continually doing
impossible things with army rations, shaping up
appetising and varied meals cooked under
heart-breaking and back-breaking conditions on
primus-stove or brazier in a three-foot corner of
dug-out or pill-box.  They did it regularly, kept
their dishes clean, and their tempers sweet.  I
salute them.
</p>

<p>
After dinner officers and men all crowded in
as well as they could, we sang a Christmas hymn
and lifted our hearts in prayer to God.  Then I
read the story of the birth of Jesus.  As I read
the familiar words in those strange surroundings
memories were stirred, and I think we were all
picturing scenes in the land across the sea.
Other days and the faces of loved ones came
before us and we were back home again and it was
Christmas time in dear old Canada.  I gave a
simple message in few words and then left.  I
spent the afternoon tramping around the
trenches seeing all the men I could to give them
Christmas greetings.  The exercise was also
almost a necessary preparation for our own
headquarters officers' dinner at six.  There we had
two roast chickens and everything good to go
with them, all cooked in his best style by our
"chef," Pte. Buchanan.
</p>

<p>
In the evening I went downstairs into the
tunnels where I planned to have a Christmas
service with the men.  Col. Urquhart and Major
Chandler came along.  We were the only ones
who had seats for we each had a folded-up
overcoat under us.  The rest of the "congregation"
sat or lay on the floor of the narrow tunnels
with candles here and there for lights.  I sat at
the junction of the two tunnels with my men
behind, to right, left and in front of me.  I read,
prayed, preached and pronounced the benediction
sitting down, for the roof was too low for
standing.  The only thing that was conventionally
"churchy" was the use of candles for lighting,
and of course my church was cruciform in
its ground plan!  But there was the Message,
there were reverent worshippers, and surely the
Unseen Presence also, and these are all you need
anywhere to constitute a Christian Church.
</p>

<p>
After the benediction and when the two
officers had disappeared up the ladder, I was
assailed by a chorus of voices with "tell us a
Yukon story," as the refrain.  I stayed, sat down
again, and there with my men gathered round
me in attentive silence I told my Klondike story
of a Christmas Day years ago.  In fancy we
travelled far from France, forgot the war, and
moved for a little while amid snow-clad mountains
and silent valleys in a vast and weirdly
beautiful land.  I named my tale a Klondike
Christmas Dinner.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was in the winter of 1904.  A week or two
before Christmas, Jas. McDougal had invited
me to have dinner on Christmas Day with him
and his wife.  Their cabin was half-way up the
mountain side on the left limit of Hunker Creek,
six miles below Gold Bottom camp where I
lived.  You need have no fear of having a "green
Christmas" in the Yukon with its eight months
of solid winter with anywhere from 50 to 90
degrees of frost.  It was "fifty below" that
morning.  Every nail-head on the door of my
cabin was white with frost.  My little stove had
its work cut out, after I lit it and hopped back
into my bunk again, before it had warmed the
cabin enough to make it comfortable for
dressing.  I remember how that fall my top
bed-blankets had got frozen solid to the logs at the
back of the bunk while I was out on the trail
one week and they never loosened up until the
Spring, so that my bed rarely got disarranged
and was very easily "made."  When I took out
some food for my dogs they crawled out of their
kennels stiff with lying for warmth all night in
one position.  The exposed parts of head and
shoulder were coated white with frost from
their breath.  They bolted their breakfast and
got back quickly to the comfort of the nests they
had left.  The gulch was filled with the white
mist which developed in extreme cold.  It hid
from my view the few cabins on the other side
of the creek.  Then I came in to get my own
breakfast.  As a special treat I had sent to
Dawson twenty miles away for a pound of beefsteak
for which I had to pay a fabulous price in
gold-dust.  It was real beefsteak but it had been "on
the hoof" too long and it was like the camp,
"tough and hard to handle."  Not so tough
though as the steak McCrimmon told me he had
got in Dawson by rare good luck in 1897 when
he had been feeding on bacon and beans for
months.  "That bit of steak," he said, "lasted
me off and on for a week.  I got away with it at
last but it was a long, hard fight.  Honest,
parson, that steak was so tough the first time I
tackled it I couldn't get my fork into the gravy."
</p>

<p>
Breakfast finished and the dishes washed I
put on my parka over my other clothes and with
fur gauntlets and moccasins I was ready for the
road.  The parka, by the way, is a loose-fitting,
smock-like garment that slips over the head and
comes down below the knees and has a hood.  It
is made of "bed-ticking" usually and so is light
to walk in but keeps the heat in and the cold
out.  First I went across to Bill Lennox's cabin
and asked him to feed my dogs at noon.  Then
I hit the trail for McDougal's.  I followed it
along the bottom of the narrow valley among
miners' windlass-dumps and cabins.  At most
of them I stepped in for a few minutes to wish
my friends a Merry Christmas and also to tell
or hear the news.  There was always something
of living interest to gossip about in those
glorious, exciting days.  Men were finding fortunes
ten or twenty feet below the surface of the
ground or even in the grass roots.  Fortunes too
they were in the alluring form of gold-dust and
nuggets, fascinating, raw, yellow gold lying
there just where God made and dropped it.
I've seen it so plentiful that it looked like a sack
of corn-meal spilled among the dirt.  It drove
men crazy, and how could they help it.  A wild,
glorious gamble it was, with the thrill of
adventure, temptation, and novelty always present,
and a wonderfully beautiful land, new and
interesting, as its setting.
</p>

<p>
It was towards noon before I turned out of the
main trail, taking one that wound its way up the
mountain side for half a mile until it came out
on a flat stretch of snow.  I was now above the
frost-fog and could see, a few hundred yards
away, a small straight plume of white smoke
rising out of what looked like a big shapely
snowdrift.  The trail ran straight to it and soon
I could see a log or two of the little cabin
showing between the comb of snow hanging from the
eaves and the snow banked up against the base.
The door was low and when it opened in
response to my knock I had to bow my head to
get in.  I entered without ceremony for they
were expecting me.  I heard a cheery voice with
a Doric accent tell me to "come right in."  I
could hear the voice but could see no one for
with the opening of the door the warm air
meeting the cold immediately formed a veil of mist.
But it was only for a moment for in the North
in winter you don't keep the door open long.
You either come in or get out, as the case may
be, without lingering on the threshold.  But what
a hearty welcome when the door was shut
behind me from McDougal and his good wife!
No delay either, no shuffling your feet in the
hall until the maid takes your card to mysterious
regions in the inner chambers of the house, and
comes back to lead you into a waiting room
where you may sit down.  Betimes the hostess
graciously appears and with formal greeting
and conventional smile gives you a hand to shake
that has on occasions as much welcome in it as
the tail of a dead fish.  But this welcome was
real, immediate, and unmistakable.  I was right
at home as soon as I stepped into the cabin for
in so doing I came into the parlour, dining room,
bed-room, and kitchen.  They hadn't even a
"but and a ben."  There was something special
about their welcome too, even in the hospitable
north.  To the miners generally I was known
as the "sky-pilot," or "parson," or by my first
or last name.  But to these two true-blue
Presbyterians with their Scottish traditions I was
always "the minister," and so in my reception
there was a respect and courtesy that gave their
greetings a rare fineness of tone.  Sometimes it
is good for you to have people place you on a
pedestal.  You usually try to measure up to
expectations and in that country self-respect
was often the sheet-anchor that kept you from
drifting to the devil.
</p>

<p>
It was only a one-room cabin eight feet wide
and twelve feet long, log walls chinked with
moss, rough board floor, roof of poles covered
with a foot of moss and a half foot of earth on
the top.  The only place I could stand upright
in it was under the ridge-pole.  There was one
window of four panes, each about the size of a
woman's handkerchief.  The glass was coated
an inch deep in frost, but some light came
through, though not enough to dispense with
candles.  Under the window was a table, simply
a shelf two and a half feet wide and three feet
long.  At the end of the cabin opposite the door
was the bed and to my left the stove, a sheet-iron
one-chambered affair with an oven in the pipe,
a simple, small Klondike stove which was not
much to look at but capable of great things when
rightly handled.  After taking off my parka it
was to the stove I went first.  It's a habit you
form in the North any way, but if you have a
moustache, as I had, the heavy icicles formed by
your breath on a six-mile walk in that extreme
cold need to be thawed off near the stove, and
that by a gentle, careful process, the reason for
this gentleness only experience would make you
appreciate.  Once this is done there is no need
to sit near the stove.  Indeed you can't get far
away from it if you stay in the cabin.
</p>

<p>
But I must describe my host and hostess.
Mr. and Mrs. McDougal looked more like brother
and sister than husband and wife.  They were
both small of stature and resembled each other.
Both were well past middle life.  Their hair was
growing grey.  They had no children, but his
pet name for his little woman was
"Grannie."  McDougal had graduated from a Scottish
University and after his marriage decided to leave
the old land for America.  They settled in
California.  As the years went on they found
themselves getting within sight of old age without
enough money laid by to save them from dependence
on others in their declining years.  Then
came the news of the gold discoveries.  It
appealed to him for he saw in this adventure a
chance to lay the haunting spectre of poverty.
Grannie stayed behind in their pretty
cottage home in the sunny south.  A year or at
most two and they hoped he would be back
with enough to put their minds at ease.  In
1897 he set out and after a trying journey
reached the Klondike in 1898.  He managed
to find and stake this shelf of pay-gravel far
up the mountain side.  It had ages ago been
part of the bed of a stream.  He worked with
eager haste to get enough to go back to his
home and loved one.  But the run of "pay"
was poor and uneven, water was scarce, and
his "tailings" required continual "cribbing" to
keep from coming down on claims in the
creek below.  It all meant enforced delay in the
realization of his hopes.  The summers came
and went with "clean-ups" good and bad but in
the aggregate not quite enough for the
fulfilment of his plans.  Grannie was wearying for
him and at last after six lonesome years she
could stand it no longer.  She heard that there
was a railway now over the White Pass and
steamboats on the river, and so in the Spring of
1903 she bravely set out for the North-land
where she could be with her man again.  Nearly
two years she had been among us, a dear little
lady with a heart so kind and pure and motherly
that she became the patron saint of our creek.
Men fiercely tempted in those strange days have
found strength to save their souls because of the
ministry of Grannie's life and words.
</p>

<p>
But we were just sitting down to dinner at the
little table in front of the window.  Now boys,
I feel guilty in describing this dinner to you
here knowing the simplicity of your army fare,
but perhaps it will be a sort of painful pleasure
for you to feast with us in imagination.  First I
said a simple grace thanking God for our food
and asking a blessing upon it and us.  We had
soup to begin with, thick hot Scotch broth it
was, then roast ptarmigan, two each of these
plump, tasty little birds which the old man had
shot from the cabin door, native cranberry sauce,
parsnips and potatoes.  These were good
"cheechako spuds" shipped in from the South.  We
had home-grown potatoes in the Klondike
sometimes, but in a summer which had one or two
nights of nipping frost every month it was hard
to ripen them.  They were usually small and
green, and so "wet" that the saying was "you
had to wear a bathing-suit to eat them."  Also of
course there was home-made bread and excellent
tea.
</p>

<p>
But the dessert was the masterpiece of the
meal.  It was a good, hot, Canadian blueberry
pie about as big round as the top of a piano-stool.
It had a lid on it and the juice was bubbling
out through the little slits.  It certainly
looked delicious and it tasted the same.  It was
cut into only four pieces.  I maintain that no
self-respecting pie should be cut into more than
four pieces except perhaps in the case of a very
large family.  Grannie gave me one piece,
McDougal one, and took one herself.  That left
one over and when I was through with my
piece I was urged of course to have the other
piece.  What could I do?  What would you
have done in my place?  Courtesy, inclination to
oblige, and my palate all said take it.  My
waist-band said, "Have a care," but it was awfully
good pie and I cleaned the plate!
</p>

<p>
Then McDougal lit his pipe.  Grannie
cleared up the table but left the dishwashing
until after I had gone as she wanted to share the
conversation.  What a jolly three hours we had!
Not a great deal there to make us happy, you
would say; a lonely log-cabin in a far land and
in the depth of an almost Arctic winter with
no other human habitation within sight or sound.
Yet we forgot the fierce cold that circled us, for
the little place was comfortable, and better still
our hearts were warm with love and friendship.
McDougal was finely educated and had travelled,
so the cabin was neither small nor lonely.
Its walls expanded and took in many guests.  A
goodly throng was there for we wandered at will
among a world of books and men.  He loved a
good, clean joke, and let me tell you when we
got going the stories both grave and gay were
worth your hearing.
</p>

<p>
Grannie was with us heart and soul in it all.
Her face beamed with cheeriness and good will.
Sometimes, however, a far-away look came into
her brown eyes.  I knew what it meant.  She
longed to get away from the North and back
again to the sunshine of her Southern home.
She was getting on in years and our extreme
winters were very trying to her.  Whenever she
got half a chance she would tell us something
about their home in California, the warm, bright
summers, the lovely gardens she and her neighbours
had, and the flowers growing in profusion,
especially the roses charming the eye and filling
the air with their perfume.
</p>

<p>
Dear wee Grannie, she never lived to go back.
One winter the brutal cold gripped her and in
spite of all we could do it took her life away.
It was a sad day when we placed her body in the
grave on that hillside.  All the creek assembled
to show their affection, and in deep sorrow.  It
was her last request that she should be buried
there.  She didn't want to be far from the man
she loved even though it meant a lonely grave
in a lonely land.  The Klondike is for
McDougal his homeland now.  Fifteen years have
passed since then and he still lives in that cabin
on the mountain slope where the woman he loves
best lies buried.
</p>

<p>
But there was no thought of sorrow that
Christmas Day.  Nowhere in the world was
there a merrier party, and when it came time for
me to go, (I had a wedding at Last Chance
Roadhouse), it was with a feeling that the cabin
had been a sanctuary of friendship, happiness
and hospitality.  When I went out into the
darkness and the bitter cold I was hardly conscious
of it for my heart was aglow.  All through these
years filled with many vivid experiences that
day has kept its brightness.  Nor will it ever
fade away but seems to shine more clearly in the
Halls of Memory as the years go by.

<i>IV.</i>
<br /><br />
<i>Some Klondike Weddings</i>
</h3>

<p>
In the fall of 1916, a month or two across from
Canada, I was posted for duty at Shorncliffe
Military Hospital, Major C. Reason of
London, Ont, commanding.  I was billeted for
a few weeks in a Sandgate private house where
the landlady used to do a little cheap profiteering
on our coal allowance.  She gave me mostly
cinders for my grate, mixed with a modicum of
coal.  The room was altogether too large for the
fireplace, and anyway I was fresh from Canada
and wasn't inured to the rigorous climate that
prevails inside English homes in winter.  I used
to write my letters in bed.  It was the only way
I could keep warm in my room for any length
of time.
</p>

<p>
Major Reason soon arranged a place for me
in the Officers' quarters and there I was quite
cosy and happy.  The Medical Officers were
congenial and made my initiation into Army
life a pleasant experience.  The style of men
they were can be judged by the fact that by
common consent we decided to read aloud a
portion of some worth-while book four evenings
a week in the Mess after dinner.  We chose "The
Professor at the Breakfast Table" by Holmes,
and that winter we read it through and no one
played truant.  Is there another Officers' Mess
that has that record?
</p>

<p>
The Officers were all strangers to me except
Captain Ferris of Edmonton, President of the
Mess.  I knew him in my Toronto University
days in the class of '98, as "Buster Ferris," when
he was one of the scrimmage bunch on the Varsity
Senior Rugby team.  Those were the days
of "Biddy" Barr, Counsell, Hobbs and McArthur
on the football field, and Hamar Greenwood,
MacKenzie King, Arthur Meighen,
Tucker, Billie Martin, and Eddie Beattie in the
Literary Society.  In 1894 the students
boycotted all lectures because of the Senate's action
in regard to Tucker and Prof. Dale.  We were
all wild "Bolshies" for a few weeks and those
I have mentioned were our leaders.  I wonder
if they still remember those revolutionary
meetings in the Spadina Ave. hall!
</p>

<p>
The Nursing Staff under Miss Urquhart gave
their services in a wholehearted spirit that was
beyond praise.  Indeed, throughout the whole
hospital staff "one unceasing purpose ran" and
that was to serve the patients in every possible
way.
</p>

<p>
The hospital was finely located on a slope
running down to the sea.  It looked south over
the Straits of Dover, where we saw the
destroyers and transports crossing and recrossing
continually, with usually a "Silver Queen" or
two floating overhead on the watch, their sides
glittering in the sunshine.  On a clear day we
could faintly discern the cliffs of France where
great deeds were being done, and whither, some
impatiently awaited day, it would be our good
luck to go, if only the war lasted long enough!
</p>

<p>
I quickly learned my duties in the hospital and
liked them.  We had an Officers' hospital, also
large surgical, venereal, and medical divisions,
usually full.  There was work for me in great
plenty and variety.  Apart from the regular
parade services there were communion services
and informal evening meetings at convenient
times and places.  Nearly every day I walked
through all the wards and as it seemed opportune
would sit down by a bedside to chat, write
a letter, or get directions for my errands.  How
varied these requests were!  One wants me to
look after his mail which he thinks is being held
up somewhere; some ask for a New Testament
or a recent book; this one has a roll of films to be
developed; another wants me to find if a certain
battalion has arrived safely from Canada and
where it is stationed for his brother is in it;
another asks me to buy two Xmas cards, "real
nice ones," one for his Mother and one for his
"next-best-girl."  This one wants a money-order
cashed; a homesick fellow wonders if I could
possibly get him one of his home-town papers;
another gives me his watch to be mended, or
would like some good stationery, or a fountain
pen.  In every case I promise to do everything I
can and all that the law allows.
</p>

<p>
Then there are those, always some, who are
passing through the Valley of the Shadow who
want to hear again about Jesus and His Love and
Power.  Nothing else will do.  Also there are
men, not many, who are downhearted, sad, or
bitter.  You wonder indeed how certain of the
poor fellows can smile at all.  Ask them how
they are and they would say through clenched
teeth and pain-drawn lips, "All right."  What
plan did I follow in dealing with these numerous
needs?  I had no plan, except to place all my
resources of body, mind and heart freely at their
disposal.  You would have done just the same,
you couldn't help yourself.  They repaid me a
thousand-fold with welcomes and friendship,
intimate confidences, and marvellous stories of
their experiences.
</p>

<p>
Apropos of the variety of a chaplain's opportunities
to serve, here's a story that was current
around the wards.  It was told to me as a good
joke on the padre.  A wounded Australian
soldier had been taken to one of the big Imperial
hospitals in the north.  None of his own
chaplains were near and so a fine old English padre
took upon himself to visit him.  For days the
chaplain's best efforts to get on friendly footing
failed.  One evening, however, after a very
satisfying dinner at the Mess the clergyman felt
he would make a special try, and with his Bible
in hand went into the ward and sat down by the
bedside.  "Now, my boy," he said, "I am going
to read you a few verses of Scripture, and I hope
they will impress you."  The soldier shammed
sleep and said nothing, seeming as unresponsive
as ever.  After a verse or two, however, he
opened his eyes and sighed deeply.  The
chaplain stopped reading and looked at him in
pleased surprise.  He smiled and said, "Go on
Sir, it is good."  Thus encouraged he read on
through the whole chapter, hearing many
deep-drawn sighs of satisfaction from the bed.  When
he was finished the soldier assured him the
reading had done him a world of good, it had been
just what he needed to make things look
brighter, and he asked the chaplain to draw his
chair up as close as he could and do him the
favor of reading it again.  This was getting on
with a vengeance, and the padre was highly
pleased with himself.  When he ended and was
warmly thanked he was curious to know what
there was in the chapter that had benefited the
soldier, and so asked him.  "Well Sir," said the
Tommy, "You're a good sort, and I'll be honest
with you.  It wasn't what you read that did me
good, but all the same you've made a hit with
me.  They've kept me on the 'water-wagon'
ever since I came to this hospital, and, Sir, your
breath has been just like a taste of heaven to
me."  Collapse of the padre!
</p>

<p>
My first attempt to tell Klondike stories in
public overseas was in an entertainment given
by the Sergeants' Mess at which I had been
asked to be the speaker.  That day I had
married one of our convalescent patients named
Pte. Trainer to a Devonshire girl.  My thoughts
were running in matrimonial channels and so I
decided to narrate some incidents connected with
two or three of my Klondike weddings.
</p>

<p>
Nearly sixty miles into the hills back of
Dawson a new run of gold had been discovered
on the Dominion Creek flats, a district that
looked so unpromising to prospectors that it
had been so far left untouched.  Some claims
had been staked on it but no prospecting done.
Ole Tweet, a Norwegian, had taken over one of
these claims as all he could get out of a bad debt.
He sank a hole on his ground and found first-class
pay.  The inevitable stampede followed
and soon cabins, windlasses, and dumps
commenced to show in all directions.  Tweet's cabin
was the first to be built and so many stampeders
had to be sheltered, that he turned temporarily
from his mining, got out logs, and built a good
roadhouse.  It was a profitable business, for he
ran a clean place where you could get plenty to
eat and a comfortable bunk, and it became the
popular resort of the miners.  He hired a cook,
an unmarried woman of middle-age, whom he
had met in Dawson.  She was a good woman in
a country where women of the right kind were
scarce, so she soon had many admirers.  Of all
the suitors for her hand there were two whom
she favored, one a Scottish Canadian, whose first
name was Archie, and the other Ole Tweet.  As
time went on she became worried because of her
continued inability to decide which of these two
men she would marry.  Both were equally
pleasing to her and they were both worthy
fellows.  She spoke to her heart and no clear
answer came back.  Yet she knew she could not
rightly keep them in suspense any longer.
</p>

<p>
Sitting one summer day by her open window,
wishing for something to help her to come to
a final decision, it chanced a little bird alighted
on the sill, looked up at her and said, "tweet,
tweet!"  The bird's chirp settled it.  Her
difficulty was solved and she accepted Ole Tweet.
That was his real name, not "fixed" for the story.
I married them in that same roadhouse on
Dominion.
</p>

<p>
It is said, but I cannot vouch for the truth of
this, that Archie was missing for a day or two
after the engagement was announced, until
someone found him in his cabin with a number of
little birds he had caught and caged, trying to
teach them to say, "Airchie, Airchie."  But it
was too late!
</p>

<p>
One of my friends, (call him Jones if you
like), a miner on Hunker Creek, had been
having such heavy clean-ups one Spring that he
determined to write to his sweetheart in Tacoma
announcing his intention of coming out before
the freeze-up that fall to marry her.  Sensible
woman that she was, she wrote back to tell him
not to come.  She would come North instead,
he could meet her in Dawson and so save the
expense of his trip out and back.  She had her
way, and I was asked to tie the knot at the Third
Avenue Hotel in Dawson.  I shall not attempt
details of the affair, only to say that I never
came so nearly disgracing myself at any sacred
ceremony as on this occasion.  The little room
was crowded with guests, standing around the
walls, sitting on chairs, on one another's knees
and on the floor, closing in around the little
six-foot space in the centre reserved for the
wedding party.  The room grew very warm and
close.  I knew Jones was nervous for he had
privately and very earnestly pleaded with me to
"make it short."  He and his best man had been
standing in front of me for full ten minutes
expecting the bride and her attendant momentarily.
Ten minutes is a long time for a man to
wait in such circumstances and we were all on
pins and needles.  By the time the door opened
to admit the bride the atmosphere had become
electrical, and when in entering, her dress caught
in the doorway and something ripped, there
were little outbursts of choked-back laughter,
and I could see poor Jones fidgetting more than
ever.  I hardly dared look at his anxious face
for it took me all my time to keep my voice at a
proper reverential pitch.  As I went on I heard,
whenever I paused, a low, persistent, irritating
noise that seemed in the room and yet was hard
to place.  I thought it must be either the
humming of the wind through a window crack, or
the distant buzz of a gasoline-saw making fuel
for Dawson's homes.  I located it at last.  It
was the subdued chattering of the bridegroom's
teeth, as if he had a severe chill!  It is an
absolute fact.  It almost floored me for a moment
and I thought I could not go on.  I paused to
regain my composure.  The silence made the
noise more distinct and explosive gurgles of
laughter here and there told me that others had
noticed it.  The perspiration ran down my face
in streams.  There was nothing for it but to
struggle on, and in an abnormally sad voice I
continued without pause, until I came to the
question asked of the groom, where I had to stop
for his reply.  If Jones had stammered his
answer I could not have held in any longer, but
would have burst into nervous laughter.  I am
thankful to say he said "I will" with never a
tremor, and I was able to finish without
disgracing "the cloth."
</p>

<p>
My last story is of a Creek wedding held in
Last Chance Roadhouse on Hunker.  It was
Christmas Day.  I had just come down the
mountain trail from McDougal's where I had
my Christmas Dinner.  The wedding party
was waiting for me when I arrived.  The
roadhouse was a low, log building about fifty
feet long and twenty wide.  There were no
partitions.  The bar was at one end, the kitchen
at the other, and the part in between was a
sort of "Anyman's Land."  It was dining-room,
parlor, and gambling room in one.  The
bunkhouse was separate.  Things were "humming"
from kitchen to bar, for remember it was
Christmas at a roadhouse on a main creek trail
in the Klondike in early days.
</p>

<p>
Not the most suitable place in the world for
a wedding.  For all that, it went through in fine
style.  We stood up beside the table and the
place grew quiet.  A blanket was hung up by
the roadhouse man in front of the bar&mdash;done
because of his innate sense of the fitness of things.
There was no bothersome noise, except the
opening and closing of the doors as people came in
and went out, and the stage-whispering of a few
men in the bar who had got too far along with
their celebrations for their fellows to control
them completely.  The names of the bride and
groom, their true names, were, Jensine Kolken
and John Peczu Kazinsky.  She was a
Norwegian Lutheran, he a Hungarian Roman
Catholic, married by a Canadian Presbyterian
minister in a Klondike roadhouse.  Rather an
unusual combination but it turned out splendidly.
They loved one another sincerely and all
these years have lived happily.  They are
prosperous and have several children.
</p>

<p>
After the wedding many toasts were drunk.
I drank mine in soda-water.  Before the toasts
Mrs. Kazinsky had gone to the kitchen and was
there busy about supper.  She was the roadhouse
cook and had a lot of work to do preparing and
serving meals to the holiday crowd.  I said
good-bye, put on parka and mitts, and set out on
my seven mile tramp to Gold Bottom, where we
had arranged a Camp Christmas Tree
Entertainment for that night.
</p>

<p>
It was cold, bitter cold, the roadhouse
thermometer said 50 below zero, and yet it was a
grand night.  We had seen no sun night or day
for weeks, but for all that it was clear as day
with a light more beautiful than that of the sun.
The whole broad, snow-white gulch around me
was flooded with light.  I looked up to the sky
and there my eyes beheld a wondrous sight,
magnificent beyond imagining.  The dome of
heaven, from east to west and from north to
south, was filled with an iridescent misty glory,
glowing with strange light in which gleamed
lovely, delicate shades of green and gold.  You
could see this luminous mist and yet see through
it as if it weren't there at all.  It was almost
uncanny, like seeing the invisible.  In the midst of
it floated the moon at the full, ablaze with
abundant light, spilling it down in wasteful
abundance mixed with the Aurora, coming to the
silent earth to change it to a glistening, white
fairy-land of unrivalled beauty.  Far, far
beyond in the clear depths of the cloudless sky
a thousand, thousand stars sparkled intensely
like well-set jewels.  As I gazed the misty glory
disappeared as if by magic and in its place I
saw great arrows of witching light shooting in
masses back and forth through the air.
</p>

<p>
I stood, as many times I did those winter
nights, spellbound and reverent in the presence
of God's handiwork.  Fancy took wing.  Perchance
this fair light was from the shining
pinions of angels as they flew hither and thither
on heavenly errands.  Perchance it was the
gleaming from a myriad spears, as the armies of
the Lord of Hosts marched and countermarched
in some Grand Parade.  Or were these the wild,
elemental forces of nature playing at games that
the Creator had taught them and that they had
played from all eternity?
</p>

<p>
Apart from these dreamings, I know I shall
never see anything, with my mortal eyes at least,
so startlingly and mystically beautiful as these
canvasses which God hangs out night after night
in the far North for all to see who will but lift
up their eyes to the heavens.
</p>

<p>
My talk was ended.  Captain Ferris, my old
friend, was in the chair and after the usual
courtesies he brought us down to "terra firma"
with a joke on the padre.  "Now, Captain
Pringle," he said, "those were wonderful sights
you saw after you left the wedding in that
roadhouse where you took only soda-water in the
toasts.  We know you so well that you didn't
need to tell us what you took.  We know you are
a teetotaller.  But, padre, for the sake of the
strangers here, and in view of the amazing things
you saw after leaving the roadhouse, say again
to the crowd distinctly, that it was "only
soda-water."  I "said it again," we all had a good
laugh, and dispersed.

I had been with the 43rd about two months
and during that time we had been out in
"rest" twice, once at Villers-au-bois and once at
Camblin l'Abbe.  They were very interesting
French towns, especially to one who had always
lived in western Canada, and although they had
been pretty badly knocked about by shelling
they were havens of refuge, rest, and comfort to
us after the trenches.  But my man Macpherson
wouldn't grow enthusiastic with me over these
two places.  "Wait till you see Auchel, sir, that's
the place for us.  Why it's the French 'home'
of the 43rd.  That's a real town and fine people,
and they think there's no other battalion quite
as good as ours."  I heard the town often spoken
about in the same way by others and was
delighted when I learned one day that we were to
move back to Auchel.  I wasn't disappointed in
my expectations.  The place had been a
prosperous farming village until the discovery of
coal nearby had developed it into a fine little
town.  It had retained much of its former
quaintness, and the mines had brought it in
contact with newer ideas by which it had benefited,
and the town was vastly cleaner, better lighted,
had better stores, and was generally more
up-to-date than the old village had been.
</p>

<p>
As in all the many thousand French towns
and villages, the Roman Catholic church edifice
was by far the largest building.  At Auchel it
was located in the Market Square without any
enclosing fence, and on the weekly market-day
when the Square was crowded with stalls many
of them would be placed against the buttresses
of the church.
</p>

<p>
Auchel was unique among the towns we knew
in France in having a neat little Protestant
Church as well, called "L'Église Evangelique."  It
was a plain building seating perhaps 150
people and built after the style of our own small
country churches.  On the wall at the right of
the platform was the verse in French, "Your
iniquities have separated between you and your
God," and on the other side, "He was wounded
for our transgressions and bruised for our
iniquities."  High on the wall behind the pulpit
was inscribed the verse, "Dieu est Amour," and
just behind the speaker were the words, "God
bless our Sunday School."  Their pastor gladly
gave us the use of the church.  We held our
Communion Service in it on Sunday and turned
it into a reading-room during the week.
</p>

<p>
It was in this Protestant church at our own
sacrament service that Capt. Jack Verner was
baptised and took his first communion.  He is
buried overseas.
</p>

<p>
It was in Auchel, when our battalion had been
warned to be ready to move at an hour's notice,
that the padre gathered a dozen Camerons who
were not on duty, got a lorry and driver, and
went off with his men to a town twenty-five miles
away to get a supply of books, magazines,
writing-paper and benches for his reading-room.  I
needed the men to load and unload the
equipment.  We were away all afternoon.  When we
came back, the adjutant, a conscientious Scot,
gave me what, from a military point of view I
richly deserved, a right good scolding.  No
orders to move had come, but if they had, there
would have been a serious reprimand coming to
somebody.  "All's well that ends well."  We
didn't move for a full ten days and in the
meantime the men had their reading-room.  Our
parade services were held in the ramshackle
building which had been a cinema before the
war.  The most inspiring part of our worship
was the singing.  There was a piano to give us
the right pitch and tempo, the congregation did
the rest.  It would have thrilled you to stand
on the platform and hear those eight hundred
men singing the grand old songs of Zion.  It
was glorious.  I was "lifted," and when the time
came for the sermon I couldn't help preaching
with heart as well as voice.  It gave me an idea
of the great loss we may sustain in over-modernizing
our church services.  The congregation
often doesn't sing, or sings feebly.  Its voice of
praise is frequently drowned out by the pipe-organ
or choir.  We obtrude these latter so much
upon the eyes and ears of the people that we seem
almost to merit the observation of a critical
Roman Catholic, that he would rather bow
before an altar and a crucifix in church, than
before a showy, loud-voiced pipe-organ and choir,
performing in front of an audience which
apparently took little part in the service except
to listen.
</p>

<p>
It was in Auchel, too, that our battalion
received its great gift from the Women's Canadian
Club of Seattle, Washington.  On May 16th,
1918 the consignment reached us.  It was, as
far as I know, the biggest present in kind that
was ever given a Canadian battalion in France.
How such bulky stuff got through at all and in
such prime condition is a miracle that someone
else will have to explain.  But there it was.  Six
big wooden boxes each half as large as a
piano-box and packed full.  There were many kinds
of things and practically enough of every kind
to give everybody in the battalion a good share
of it all.  I had to have a parade (voluntary),
and Macpherson and I handed out the stuff,
which we had unpacked and arranged, to the
men as they lined up.  There were great
quantities of fine candies in bulk and in many small
fancy boxes, lots of chewing-gum and tobacco,
hundreds of cigars and thousands of cigarettes.
There were a score of immense homemade fruit
cakes.  Then there was a generous abundance of
dates, raisins, figs, writing-paper, pipes, pencils,
fountain-pens, safety razors, snuff, vaseline, soap,
tooth-brushes, wash-rags, socks, sapadilla,
handkerchiefs, tooth-paste, shaving-soap, medicines,
joke-books and many odds and ends in smaller
quantities.  Most of the smaller parcels were
tied up in pretty ribbon and white tissue-paper
with Christmas cards in them and ornamented
with Christmas labels, for the boxes had been
due three months before.
</p>

<p>
It was in Auchel that I talked to my men
about northern dogs.  One evening we gathered
in L'Église Evangelique and I told them some
stories about wolf-dogs I had known or handled.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
One winter I heard that a group of men were
prospecting on Duncan Creek about two hundred
miles farther out than my location at Gold
Bottom.  I decided to take a month or two away
from my regular circuit on the creeks around
me and pay a visit to these new diggings, take
along some reading matter, tell them the news,
have some services, and bring back their mail.
</p>

<p>
I needed a dog-team for the trip.  My own
dogs were not then old enough for a long journey
nor were they properly broken, and so I picked
up an odd dog here and there on the creek until
I had a string of six.  They were of mixed sorts
but all had been broken to the sleigh, and their
owners, who had no work for them, were glad
to have the dogs taken off their hands, fed and
cared for.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to speak of them all but only
of three that had more distinctive characters
than the others.
</p>

<p>
When we travel with dogs in the North they
are hitched up tandem (usually) to a sleigh
about two feet wide, a foot from the ground, and
eight or nine feet long, and are guided by voice
and gestures only.  There are no reins.  Of
course you carry a black-snake whip to urge the
lazy ones on.  This whip is about ten feet long
with a heavy loaded butt needed for protection
if a refractory husky should turn on you.  The
leader is the all-important dog.  The others
have only to keep their traces taut and follow on,
but the leader has to use his head with all his
wolf and dog senses and instincts.  He must find
and keep on top of the old trail if there is one
buried under the drifts, know whether new ice
is safe enough or not, and avoid the serious peril
of water under the snow, for at very low
temperature, with creek channels frozen solid, water
is squeezed out and runs under the snow.  It
of course freezes very quickly, but if you and
your dogs get into it, while still liquid in
extreme cold weather, it means an immediate
camping to save your feet and those of your
dogs, and dry wood may not be near just then.
This may well mean death, for death soon comes
to the crippled man or dog away from help in
the sub-arctic winter if he cannot build a fire.
Your leader too, must respond to all the few
words of command.  These are "Mush!", a
corruption, through the old French-Canadian
Coureurs-du-bois of "Marchez!"; "Whoa!", the
whole team knows that welcome word; "Gee!"
to turn to the right, and "Haw!" to swing to
the left.
</p>

<p>
Now this pick-up dog-team of mine was
strange to me and I to them, so the introduction
was a fight or two until they knew I was boss.
Then I had to "learn" my dogs and place them
in the string so that they could work properly,
and also see that they all did work until they
became a real team where each dog was doing
his share.
</p>

<p>
I first picked on a big grey-muzzled malemute
named Steal as a likely fellow to lead.  Dogs'
names there don't usually indicate their character,
but his did.  All malemutes are born thieves,
some men think.  I don't agree, but in this case
I had a thief by nature, education, and name.
He would break into your "cache" if it could
be done and steal what he fancied.  His owner
claimed he could read labels on canned goods,
for he would carry away bully-beef tins but not
canned-fruit.  It was his keen nose, not his eyes
of course, that told him the difference.  Once
you knew of this failing it could be easily
guarded against on the trail.  It would have
been of little moment if Steal had done his duty
as leader.  He knew all the tricks of the trail
and would have made a fine leader if he had
tried to do his bit.  But I hadn't gone far before
I realized that he wouldn't work away from the
whip.  Running behind the eight-foot sleigh I
had it and the five dogs between me and Steal.
His traces were always trailing.  He would
rarely quicken his pace no matter how fiercely
I shouted "Mush on, you malemute!", nor for
the crack of the whip.  I had to run along beside
the team on the narrow trail, throwing them
partly off, before I could reach him with the
whip.  Then he would dig in for a few hundred
yards but soon commenced to slow down,
continually looking back to see if I were coming at
him again.  This performance was demoralizing
to team and driver, so some change had to be
made.  I put a smaller dog named Mike in the
lead and hitched Steal up next the sleigh as my
"wheel-dog."  He worked there.  He knew
perfectly that his game was up and put his
shoulder against the collar from that on.  He
was that sort of dog that works well under the
lash, although as a fact I never had to strike him
now.  I simply cracked the whip above him
if he showed signs of shirking and he would
get right in and pull, at the same time emitting
a series of howls that could not have been more
woeful if he were being killed.  Anyway, I
could see that the dogs in front took it as a
warning of the punishment awaiting the laggard
and would pull so hard I would sometimes
have to slow them down.
</p>

<p>
Do not think I was cruel, or drove the dogs at
their top speed always.  In the north there is
more real kindness and expert care used by
dog-mushers in handling their wolf-dogs than in
the way pet-dogs and house-dogs are treated in
our cities.  A dog doesn't appreciate having its
nose kissed by human lips, and it is gross
unkindness to let unthinking impulse lead you to
over-feed them, or give them wrong food and
make them sick and weak.  It is cruel to keep
your dog chained up for days at a time alone in
your back-yard, varied only by taking him out
for a walk usually on a leash.  Our trail-dogs
are almost always healthy, hungry, and happy.
Each day they have, what every dog really needs
and loves above all else, a long run in the wilds
with other dogs, satisfying the old, inborn,
"pack" instinct.  They are carefully fed, not
much in the morning, perhaps a chunk each of
dried salmon and the same at noon.  A good
feed at dawn or during the day would mean a
sick or "heavy" dog along the trail.  But at night
the first meal prepared is for the dogs, a good,
big, hot feed of boiled rice, cornmeal, or
oatmeal, with a liberal allowance of fat bacon cut
up and mixed in and perhaps a couple of
dog-biscuits each to crunch for dessert.  Every toe
of every dog was examined daily and any sign
of sensitiveness would mean a salve, or, if
expedient, a soft moccasin small enough to fit the
foot and protect it from the trail.  The dogs
were felt carefully all over to see if they were
sore anywhere.  Too much depended on his
dogs on the trail for a man to be careless, or
harsh, or ignorant, in their handling.
</p>

<p>
Mike was a dandy little dog and served me
well the whole journey through.  He wasn't as
knowing on the trail as Steal and got us into a
tumble that might have had troublesome results.
Travelling along a ledge running about fifteen
feet above the bottom of the gulch, he took the
team too near the edge and got on the "comb"
of snow which broke off with him and he
dragged the whole team, sleigh, and driver over
the brink, to roll in a confused heap to the
bottom.  It took me an hour, when daylight was
precious, to get straightened out and going
again, but otherwise we were none the worse.
</p>

<p>
I found that Mike had one other fault.  It
took me two or three days to notice it.  He had
the knack of keeping his traces straight but not
tight.  He rarely pulled more than enough
just to keep them from sagging.  No matter how
hard the going Mike was only a "leader."  He
never got down and pulled.  I hesitate to criticize
him, for at least he did do his work as leader
when without him I'd have been in a fix.  He
did his own part, carried his own harness, and
willingly.  That's a great, good quality, in dog
or man.  Often, though, I wished he would
forget being a leader, drop his dignity, and just
be an ordinary work-dog, especially in deep
snow climbing a steep bank when the other dogs
and the driver were pulling and shoving with
all our strength to make the grade.
</p>

<p>
At Duncan I found a hearty welcome and
spent ten days visiting around the cabins.
Before I started back an old-timer named Brodeur
came into camp limping behind his dogs.  His
axe had glanced while felling a tree and gashed
his foot.  First-aid was given, but it was evident
that he should be taken to Dawson where he
could get expert surgical treatment.  We
arranged that he should come back with me.
Before we left he sold his dogs and sleigh for
thirty-five ounces of gold, about five hundred
dollars.  The dog he wouldn't sell was his
leader, named Shep, the best sleigh-dog I have
ever seen in the north.  Brodeur refused to sell
him for any money, not, however, because of
the dog's usefulness, that would have had a
market value, but for what you would call
sentimental reasons.  To put it simply, they loved
each other.
</p>

<p>
Of course there was only one place in the
team for this king among dogs and Mike now
came second in the string.  What a grand dog
Shep was!  I can't tell you half his fine
qualities.  I don't know what noble dog breed was
mixed with the wolf in him, but he was master
of the team, in harness and out of it, from the
start, and they seemed to sense it and not resent
it.  The first night Steal tried to dispute it by
leaving his own pile of hot rice to snap some
from the far-side of Shep's.  Before you could
think Steal was down half-buried in the snow
yelling in his accustomed way, while Shep
nipped a few little slits in his ears.  It wasn't a
fight.  It was corrective punishment properly
administered, in the same spirit in which you
spank your little boy.  A dog can travel quite
as well with a few healthy cuts in his ears as
without.  Was it Shep's way of boxing his ears?
Shep was no bully, but he wouldn't allow any
fights among the dogs.  He had, too, the rare
art of "jollying" the team along the trail.  This
was seen when the going had been hard all day
and the dogs were growing weary.  Then he
would talk to them as he travelled in his
whining, malemute way, and it would seem to
brighten them up.  Perhaps he told them funny
dog stories, or pictured the joys of a good supper
when they got to dry timber and camped.
Whatever your explanation, Shep was the cause,
and the effect was seen in a brisk and willing
lot of dogs going strong at the close of the day.
Always he pulled his best.  Whenever it was
heavy sledding he would get right down
dog-fashion, with his belly close to the trail,
tongue hanging out, and do all he knew to keep
things moving; heart, lungs, muscles, toe-nails
and teeth were all enlisted in his effort to serve
the man he loved who was riding under the
robe in the sleigh behind.  How did he use his
teeth?  This way&mdash;Climbing up a bank through
the brush, making around an overflow on the
creek, we were nearly being stalled; Shep, not
content with his usual efforts, had managed to
grip with his teeth a stout branch that stretched
conveniently near, and was using teeth and
neck-muscles to add to his pulling power!  Do you
wonder that Brodeur loved the dog?  Shep
never knew the feel of the whip in punishment.
At night when the team was unharnessed his
first move was to the sleigh where he shoved
his muzzle into the old man's hand and looked
into his face asking him, I suppose, if
everything was going well.
</p>

<p>
We reached Dawson in good form and soon
had Brodeur comfortably located in the "Good
Samaritan" hospital.  Shep made his bed, the
first night, in the snow a few yards from the
door, but he discovered which window was
Brodeur's, and he camped under it against the
logs of the hospital until his master was well.
The foot mended rapidly and soon the old
trapper and his noble dog were back in the hills
again.

<br /><br />
<i>Lost on the Divide</i>
</h3>

<p>
In March and April, 1918, the Canadians
were lying along the low ground beyond
Vimy Ridge, facing the Germans who held the
Lens-Mericourt-Arleux front.  The 43rd was
entrenched about a mile forward from the base
of the Ridge.  We had taken over from the
"Yorks and Lane's" who had done a lot of
excellent engineering in the sector they had been
holding.  The trenches had been deepened and
well drained.  The dug-outs were numerous,
large, and mostly safe.  The months of their
tenure had been quiet, and everything was in
good repair.  No Man's Land was wide, a
quarter mile in places, smooth, covered with
grass, and inhabited by colonies of larks.
Apparently no raiding had been done, for that
always brings some artillery retaliation showing
in parapets and barbed wire knocked about, and
ground torn by explosives.
</p>

<p>
When the Canadians commenced raiding, the
Hun still held himself well in check, in spite
of the loss of a few men killed or taken prisoner
every night or two.  He had a tremendous
surprise developing for our Fifth Army away to
our right flank, and he didn't care to "start
anything" with us that might disarrange his plans.
Not that we were left severely alone, for it was
on this same comparatively quiet front, on
Wednesday afternoon, April 3rd, that I saw
more enemy shells drop on one particular spot
in a limited time than I ever saw happen in any
other sector.
</p>

<p>
Our Regimental Aid Post was a spacious
comfortable place underground off "Vancouver
Road," and there some 3rd Field Ambulance
"bearers" had taken up their quarters along with
our medical section.  The dug-out had only the
one defect of not being any too deep for safety.
Well, it so happened that something had aroused
the enemy's suspicions about our Post.  Maybe
the fresh earth thrown out from a little
trench-improvement work near us had attracted the
notice of the German air-men.  Whatever the
cause they evidently had come to the decision
that it would be wise to "shoot us up," which
they did with a vengeance.  Captain Mackenzie
and I were coming down the sunken road when
the fusilade opened.  At first we thought it was
the usual stray shell or two, but for three hours
we couldn't get within fifty yards of the place.
The Hun gunners lobbed them over unceasingly.
The dust of an explosion was still in the air when
you could hear the hum of another shell coming.
We were held up and just had to wait for the
"strafe" to cease, anxiously wondering if the roof
was holding and our men were safe.
</p>

<p>
It stopped at last and we ran down the road.
One of the entrances was smashed in but the
other still held up.  We went downstairs to find
our men crowded into one small portion of the
Post that remained intact.  All around was
evidence of their miraculous escape.  I shuddered
to think what would have been, had a shell
penetrated the roof there and burst among them.
</p>

<p>
McClymont told me that their lights were
blown out seventy-two times by the concussion
of shells exploding near the entrances, and that
when they went out about the twenty-fifth time
Macpherson started them singing some music-hall
choruses to relieve the strain.  About the
fiftieth time, by mutual unspoken consent, they
changed to hymns!  I'd have changed long
before that; indeed I doubt if I could have
found voice steady enough for song!
</p>

<p>
The foregoing facts I glean from an old
notebook in which at the time I further jotted down
that "the Hun threw 235 "5.9" shells on and
around our R.A.P. in less than three hours.
One entrance was crumpled in and dirt and
bricks heaped on our beds.  Twenty men there
but no one hurt.  The shelling represents a
waste of twenty-five thousand dollars, and our
cosy home gone."
</p>

<p>
That night we moved across the road to a
deeper dug-out, one that had been built by the
Germans, located by Sergt. Sims.  Talking in
the evening after supper about the day's event,
our conversation naturally went afield to other
adventures, and I was led to speak of a narrow
escape from death I had in very different
circumstances in a distant land.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
In nearly eleven years of the Yukon trails,
living on the creeks among the mountains in
early Klondike days, I could not fail to have my
share of memorable experiences, some of them
with more than a spice of hazard.  I lived just
the regular life of a "musher"&mdash;a man on the
trail&mdash;and while that mode of life assuredly
held nothing of monotony, yet I grew so accustomed
to it that it all seemed part of the usual,
familiar course of things.
</p>

<p>
After the summer, beautiful but brief, there
came the eight months of grim, relentless winter.
Then we had to face the long darkness and the
deadly cold; to travel vast, white valleys filled
with an almost terrifying silence broken only by
the ugly howling of the wolves; to battle through
deep and drifting snow along miles of lonely
summits, with blizzards blinding and bewildering.
But against each problem or task that
Nature set us we matched, with zest, our wits
and skill.  There was the joy of conflict in it.
Experience made us self-reliant and we learned
to love the life, so free and clean, so full of
stirring incident and victorious combat with the
elements.  Only now am I commencing to get
the true perspective of those Yukon days, and
by comparison with the soft conventional life
of these later years, recognizing how unique and
interesting they were.
</p>

<p>
There comes to my mind a very unpleasant
time I had one winter night, when I lost my way,
broke my word, and spoiled a happy gathering.
If it were a sermon, my text would be, "Let him
that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."
</p>

<p>
The Christmas festivities in the Yukon long
ago usually continued for about a month.  The
weather was so frosty that work on the windlass
was both disagreeable and risky, so it became
customary for the mid-winter weeks to be
occupied in visiting or entertaining neighbours and
friends.  Small "parties" were held in a sort of
rotation at the larger cabins up and down the
valleys.  Everybody was merrymaking.  Hospitality
knew no artificial bonds, for in those golden
days, there was neither prince nor peasant,
rich nor poor.  Don't think from this that we
had no right social standards.  I know that
much of the fiction about the North is built
on the theory that the men in the Klondike
diggings practically adopted the moral code of the
brothel.  That assumption may make a novel
"spicy" and increase its sale, but nevertheless it
is quite untrue.  We, of the creeks, had worthy
moral standards, simple but definite, and rigidly
enforced.  Our social grading, however, was not
based on the length and value of a man's "poke,"
nor on his grandfather's record.  If he lived an
honest, decent life among us, he was barred from
nothing.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the many smaller affairs, each
gulch, where there were miners, would have one
big evening for all, church or roadhouse being
requisitioned for the occasion.  These were
called Christmas Tree Entertainments, or simply
"Trees" for short.  It was one of my duties to
name the members of committees to have charge
of all arrangements, and I was also expected to
be chairman at all the "Trees."  To meet this
last requirement each creek had to choose a
different date so that I could make the rounds.
</p>

<p>
In the winter of 1905 we had carried through
our entertainments at Last Chance, Gold
Bottom, and Gold Run.  Sulphur Creek was the
last, and they had been working to make it the
best of all.  It was to be held on Dec. 28th.
One of the Sulphur men, Robertson, had come
over to Gold Bottom to "size up" the programme
there and report to his committee.  He told me
that Sulphur's Tree would easily eclipse the
others, and that I must on no account miss it.
"You can depend on me, Robertson," I said,
"and I'll see whether you Sulphurites can make
good your boast.  I'll have to 'mush' across from
Gold Run that afternoon, but I won't disappoint
you."
</p>

<p>
At noon Dec. 28th a very happy party of six
old "tillicums" were gathered in Jordan's cabin
on Gold Run.  His partner Jim Prophet was
there, Coldrick the Londoner, Macgregor the
Australian, Bousfield and myself.  Prophet had
been lucky enough to get a moose that had
strayed into the valley within rifle-shot and it
lay partly cut up on some poles by the "cache."
So he had invited his friends in to help eat some
of the choicest parts, moose-steak in ordinary
being, of course, too common for a special feast.
I shall forbear entering into details of that meal,
but our meat-dish was young moose-heart
stuffed, roasted, with fresh Klondike river
grayling as an entree.  Grayling are caught in the
fall when slush ice is running in the river.
They are sluggishly heading for deep water.
You fish for them with rod and line baiting
with raw meat.  When you pull one out he
freezes stiff almost before you can get him off
the hook.  You catch what you need, take them
home, and stack them up like firewood in the
cache where they will remain frozen.  There
you have your winter's supply of absolutely
fresh fish.
</p>

<p>
We were sitting at the table when there came
a knock on the door, and in response to Jordan's
hearty "Come in," it was opened and the form
of our good friend Corp. Haddock, of the North
West Mounted Police, emerged through the
mist.  He sat down a minute or two but wouldn't
stay.  He was calling at all the cabins giving
orders that no one was to attempt to leave the
valley until the weather moderated.  The
barracks thermometer registered 65° below zero,
and a dense fog had formed.  Under these
conditions it was perilous to attempt any journey
away from human habitations.  No one spoke
of my intended trip, (although I found out later
that Haddock knew my plans), until he had
gone, when Coldrick said, "That puts the finish
on your mush to Sulphur, Pringle."  "No," I
replied, "I gave my word I'd be there and they
will be looking for me.  I have crossed that
divide fifty times.  I know every flake of snow
on it.  Unless the corporal catches me and puts
me in the 'cage,' I'll be chairman at the Sulphur
Church this evening."
</p>

<p>
This sounds boastful and foolhardy, but as a
fact it was neither.  I realized perfectly what
I was facing, and knew that, barring accidents,
I could keep my promise.  I had fifteen miles
in all to go, and only one mile of it difficult
travelling through deep snow on the low
summit, and for that I had my snowshoes.  True,
it was extremely cold, but I was suitably clothed
and knew how to take care of myself, surely,
after six years constantly on the trail.
</p>

<p>
So Jordan went out to get my snowshoes.  He
came in with the unexpected news that my
snowshoes, and likewise their two pair, had
disappeared from their pegs.  It was plain that
Haddock was "wise," and had taken them along
with him down creek in a well-meant effort to
make me stay indoors.  I would have to go six
miles down the trail and back to get another pair,
and they also might not be there.  That was out
of the question.  I hesitated only long enough
to picture the trail.  There was only that one
mile on which I used the shoes, and though the
snow there was deep I could wade through
without them.  It would mean perhaps an hour
longer, but it wasn't two o'clock yet and I had a
full six hours to travel fifteen miles.  I decided
to go.
</p>

<p>
I set out and made fast time until I struck the
drifts on the summit.  The short spell of gloom
we called day had ended, and it was rapidly
growing dark.  Before I got over that mile there
would be no light, and this unpleasant white fog
would be blindfolding my eyes as well.  With it
all I didn't worry.  This was a difficult job that
faced me, but I was in my own workshop, had
my own tools, and was working at my own trade.
Fate, however, had decreed that I should botch
things this time.
</p>

<p>
Somehow, unwittingly, I turned a gradual
quarter circle to the right in the drifts, and was
then travelling along the low, undulating divide
instead of across it.  Laboriously but confidently
I kept on through the darkness and the fog,
unconscious of my error, until, after three hours,
I found myself at the foot of a grade that I had
thought was the slope down into the Sulphur
valley.  I soon found my mistake.  It must have
been some large cup-shaped depression on the
divide, its bottom strewn with a fearsome tangle
of fallen trees carried down by a snow or
landslide.  For two testing hours I fought my way
through that piled up brush and snow.  When
I got clear I felt myself on an up-grade.
</p>

<p>
It was a long climb out of that hateful valley
and I knew now that I was lost.  To try to
retrace my steps would have been suicide.  I had
given up all hope of reaching Sulphur in time
for the Tree and was growing a trifle anxious.
It was terribly cold and dark.  I had been
working extremely hard for hours and I was getting
hungry.  I didn't dare to stand still or rest.  My
moccasin thong had come undone and I had to
take off my mitts to fix it.  So sharp was the frost
that my fingers grew almost too stiff to do the
work and I nearly failed to tie the lace.  They
were white and numb when I thrust them into
my fur gauntlets, beating them against my chest
as I went on.  My whole body sensed the chill
and threat of that momentary stop.  It told me
that if I were forced to take my last chance for
life and try to build a fire, I would almost surely
fail; to find dry wood, to prepare it, to light
it, and wait nursing it into a flame sufficient to
warm me would be a succession of almost hopeless
chances, too desperate to take now unless
there were no other way.
</p>

<p>
My climb brought me at last out above the
frost-fog, and I thanked God I could see His
stars and get my bearings.  Far away to right
and left in the darkness I knew the valleys of
Gold Run and Sulphur lay, but between me and
them stretched impossible miles of rough
country.  Puzzled a moment my anxious eyes caught
the flicker of a light, low down in the north,
hardly to be distinguished from the stars on the
sky-line.  This was indeed my "star of hope."  It
meant warmth, and warmth was life to me.
I fixed its location and with new heart headed
for it.
</p>

<p>
For six hours I travelled straight away like
a hunted moose.  I was young, lean and fit as a
wolf.  I was tired but not at all exhausted.  In
wind and limb I was good for miles yet.  But
I was becoming exceedingly hungry, and felt
the clutching, icy fingers of the frost getting
through my clothes, and I knew there was no
time to waste.  Hunger and ninety-five degrees
of frost on the trail combining against you with
darkness as their ally, will soon club you into
unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
However the game isn't lost or won until the
referee blows his whistle.  I was determined to
fight it right out to the finish.  The light was my
goal and I forgot all else.  I must get to it even
though I might have to crawl at last with frozen
hands and feet.  In the hollows I lost sight of
it, picking it up again on higher ground, until,
when I knew I hadn't much time left me, it
glimmered clear, down hill, not a hundred yards
away.  I'll tell you the lights in Paradise will
not look so beautiful to me as did the Jo-Jo
Roadhouse bonfire that night, for they had a
big fire outside under an iron tank melting snow
for water and it was the flame of this I had seen.
</p>

<p>
My fumbling at the latch roused Swanson,
the owner, from his sleep.  He opened the door
and pulled me in and I was safe.  I had been
beaten in my endeavour to get to Sulphur in
time for the Tree, but I was victor in a more
serious contest.  I had won a game against heavy
odds in which the stakes were life, or death, or
maiming.
</p>

<p>
They told me later at Sulphur, that at half-past
eight the crowd at the Tree got uneasy, and
by nine o'clock the concert was declared off and
a well-equipped search-party set out with
dog-teams.  They went the round-about but
well-trodden trail down to the mouth of Gold Run,
and up that creek, until they found my solitary
tracks turning off to the divide.  They sent their
dogs back to the Gold Run cabin with one of
the party, and followed my trail all night on
snowshoes, making the Jo-Jo late next morning
an hour after I had left on Swanson's shoes for
Sulphur.
</p>

<p>
I arrived at that camp by an easy route early
in the afternoon.  I had made their Tree a
failure, I had broken my word, I had disobeyed
Police orders, but I didn't get a scolding even,
from anybody.

<h3>
<i>VII.</i>
<br /><br />
<i>A Strange Meeting</i>
</h3>

<p>
The German High Command had a big
surprise to spring on the British Army in
France early in 1918.  Their preparations
culminated in the smashing attack they made in
March on the Fifth Army commanded by
General Gough.  The Canadians lay facing
Mericourt beyond Vimy at that time.  To our right,
covering Arras and beyond, the Third Army,
under General Byng was holding, on their right
lay the Fifth Army.  Before and during their
great effort the Germans refused to be "drawn"
at Mericourt into any serious retaliation, no
matter how often we raided them.  We knew
why later when General Gough's line went to
pieces.  The Huns were going to "get us," they
believed, in another and more thorough way
than by counter-raids.
</p>

<p>
It looked for some weeks as if they might
realize their hopes.  The Fifth Army's formation
was broken, and in confusion, they were
driven back and back for miles, until with
reinforcements they managed to hold only a short
distance in front of Amiens.  In a few days the
British lost, in prisoners alone, 200,000 men.
To save themselves from being outflanked the
Third Army had to withdraw from a portion
of their former line and swing their right wing
back facing out.  They completed the difficult
movement with brilliant success, and presented
to the enemy an unbroken front of fighting men,
well-munitioned, and supported by an effective
artillery fire.  This move saved the British
forces from what looked like imminent disaster.
</p>

<p>
Byng's men used Arras as their pivotal sector.
It was only a few miles from us, and it was with
anxious hearts we heard, those days and nights,
the ceaseless thunder of the guns on our right,
as the terrific struggle continued.  It was dismal
news too, that came from Belgium.  There Mt. Kimmel
had fallen, and the British had been
strategically forced to evacuate all the ground
we had won at such enormous cost around
Passchendaele; and this, remember, was the
fourth year of the war.
</p>

<p>
Those were fateful days for the Canadians.
Our front was quiet, but we were nevertheless
in an extremely perilous location.  Vimy Ridge
was behind us, and behind it again was lower
ground which would be hard to hold in a
flanking attack by our enemy.  Many additional
batteries had been crowded in on the Ridge with
their silent guns trained on Arras lest the Third
Army, which still occupied that town, should
be broken and the Germans get through.  In
that event the Canadian Corps would probably
have been cut off by the enemy's advance
through the valleys behind us, and our career,
as a Corps, would have ended.  Certainly we
would have sold our lives and freedom dearly,
but with lines of communication cut our position
would have soon been untenable, and successful
retreat probably very nearly impossible.  Don't
dream that the front-line men were panicky.
We knew that millions of brave men were still
facing our common enemy and that back of them
and us was the indomitable will of our Empire
and our Allies.  In this connection I recall a
conversation between our Col. Urquhart (a
thorough Scot), and a visiting officer, in which
they referred to the situation at Arras.  "It is
very serious indeed," said our guest, "for if the
British break there, we Canadians are in for our
biggest tussle with the Hun."  "Do you know,"
asked Urquhart, "what troops of ours are
engaged there?"  "Yes," was the reply, "the 15th
Division."  "Well," said the Colonel, "that is
a Scottish Division, and I can assure you, sir,
there will be no break at Arras."  Nor was there.
Those Scottish lads stood firm.  Repeated and
determined attacks by the finest German troops
could not break their front, nor drive them from
their ground.  The critical days passed, the
enemy's progress was everywhere effectually and
permanently stopped.  Then when we were
thoroughly prepared we took the initiative, and
in August, the same year, commenced that grand
victorious advance which ended the war.
</p>

<p>
Those days we often keenly discussed the
situation from many angles.  I was in "A"
Company's dug-out one time when we were giving
our opinions as to the relative merits of some of
the different units of the British Army.  We
got away from the present war into history, and
were recalling other famous campaigns and the
exploits of the troops engaged in them.
Someone said that while Canada, since she became a
Dominion, had not had much chance until now
to become illustrious in war, yet for forty years
she had maintained the finest force of military
police in the world, the Royal North-West
Mounted.  I was proud to mention that my
brother had served in that crack organization
for thirty years, and from that remark I was
eventually entangled in the yarn which I here
unravel.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
I am the youngest of ten.  My two brothers,
John and James, were grown up and away from
home before I had got beyond infancy.  John
visited us frequently after I had reached
boyhood.  James enlisted with father's consent in
the North-West Mounted Police, went west and
never returned.  That force was organized in
1873 and my brother joined them in 1878.
When I was a young lad there was no doubt in
my mind which was my favorite brother.  John
was a minister, and ministers were an unknown
quantity to a youngster of my age, and so I
wasn't much taken with my preacher brother.
</p>

<p>
But it was different with James.  He was a
soldier and a specially interesting sort of soldier.
His business was chiefly, so I thought anyway,
to go galloping on horseback across the prairies
of our wild west, chasing bad Indians and
horse-thieves, and having all kinds of real adventures.
How I longed for him to come home!  I pictured
him, in fancy, riding down our main
street in Police uniform, with pistols in his belt
and perhaps a knife too, his carbine slung by
his saddle, and handling easily a spirited horse!
I would then point him out with pride to the
other boys as my brother, and maybe, when he
saw me, he would come riding over to the
sidewalk and speak to me in front of all the other
fellows.  My boyish heart used to glow as I
imagined what might possibly soon come true.
</p>

<p>
The prairies were undoubtedly a very long
distance off in those days.  There were no
rail-ways on them, none indeed to carry you to their
outer-boundaries in Canada.  Parties of police
recruits went down through the United States
to Fort Benton or other suitable points, and then
came north, mostly by trail, to the Canadian
plains.  It was a long journey, I knew, but on
the other hand mother used to get letters from
him, and he would say in them that he might be
home for Christmas, a treasured hope.  Nearing
Christmas mother would be busier than ever in
the kitchen, making the cakes and other good
things we always had in abundance at that festive
season.  I liked to be on hand then for there
were bowls, in which tasty confections had been
mixed, that required scraping out and it was my
delight to attend to them.  She would often talk
to me then about her soldier boy, and I was an
eager listener.  "Maybe your brother James
will be home this Christmas," she would say
with a glad note in her voice.  Then there would
come the letter containing the unwelcome news
that he couldn't get a furlough this year, they
were so short of men and had such a vast territory
to patrol, but we would surely see him next
year.  Mother would go into her room for a
while with the letter, and when she came out
she would take me on her knee, hug me up to
her and kiss me, then would go about her work
strangely silent.  Her soldier boy never came
home.  He went farther west and north, and my
story is of the first meeting I had with my
brother, the first anyway I had any memory of.
It occurred in the Yukon in a roadhouse on
Eureka creek.
</p>

<p>
I visited that creek regularly about once a
month.  To reach it I had to "mush" down the
Indian River valley, ten miles from the mouth
of Gold Run, and then cross the river to Eureka
which flowed in from the opposite side.  Five
miles up Eureka was the first cabin.  Above
that on both forks of the stream there were
miners.  In summer I could cross Indian by a
shallow ford and in winter on the ice, but for
a trip or two in the Spring it was a tumultuous
flood which I had to navigate on a make-shift
raft.
</p>

<p>
It was in the Spring of 1902 when making this
trip I found the river, as I expected, in spate.
I was prepared with axe, rope, and a few spikes,
and in an hour or two had a small, rough float
constructed.  I made and launched it a hundred
yards above the point I sought to reach on the
other bank, for I knew the rapid current would
carry me down that distance at least before I
could effect a landing.  On this side of the river
there was no one nearer than ten miles, for this
was the "back-entrance" to Eureka, (Bonanza
and Dawson lying off in another direction), so
I always wrote out a note stating what I was
attempting to do, dated it, and put it up on a tree
by the trail.  Thus if anything unexpected
happened, some "musher," coming by within a week
or two, would know the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Then I pushed out into the water with my
rough paddle.  I had a light pack on my back
holding my shoes, a dry pair of socks, and other
trail accessories.  That time I had made my
raft rather too small.  I had to stand in the
centre or it would tip me off, and it wasn't
easy to keep my poise in rough water with the
logs mostly out of sight under my feet.  When
within a few yards of the other side, my frail
craft caught for a moment on a hidden snag
which tore some of the lashings loose, and the
two outside logs showed signs of getting adrift.
If that occurred I would shortly be swimming
for my life in the surging, ice-cold water.  The
raft was only about seven feet across and to save
it from breaking up I "spread-eagled" on it,
catching the rope ends with each hand and thus
holding it together.  I had to lie almost flat to
do this, and for the next five minutes was giving
a life-like imitation of a submarine about to
submerge.  Luckily my raft struck the bank,
I caught the limb of a tree and swung myself
ashore.  I made the five miles to Macmillan's
cabin in double-quick time and stayed the day
there in the bunk, with my clothes drying out
around the stove.
</p>

<p>
During the next two days I went around the
cabins visiting, and "ringing the church bell"
for a meeting in the roadhouse.  There we
gathered in the evening, not a man absent that
could come.  The roadhouse became a church,
with the bar-counter my lectern.  On it I had a
lighted candle which I had to hold in my right
hand, the book in my left, when I read or we
sang, so that I could see the words distinctly.
The business of the place was practically suspended
except the cooking at the kitchen end, and at
odd times when a traveller came in for a drink or
a meal he would be served quietly, and then go
on his way or stay as he was minded.  The
stools and benches were filled and some men
were sitting on the floor around the walls.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of my sermon two "mounties"
entered at the door behind me.  They closed the
door and stood near it listening.  I turned my
head for a casual glance at the newcomers,
stammered, stuck, and couldn't go on.  I turned
from my congregation, and, taking the candle in
my hand, stepped nearer.  There before me was
the man whose face I had so often gazed at, with
silent admiration, as I saw it in the photograph
in my mother's room.  It was indeed my brother
James, the hero of my boyhood days!  Our
hands clasped as I spoke his name.  I turned to
the crowd, told them what had happened, and
that I couldn't go on with the address.  They
understood.  We sang a hymn and ended the
service forthwith.
</p>

<p>
The talk I had with my new-found brother
can be better imagined than described.  He had
been sent from the upper country, the Tagish
Post, to the Eureka detachment, had arrived that
evening and had heard that a "George Pringle"
was having a meeting on the creek.  He had
come over confident that it was his "little"
brother, for he knew I was in the Klondike.
</p>

<p>
We spent a day together, one of the
never-to-be-forgotten days of my life.  Then the next
morning I started back on my circuit.  He came
with me to Indian.  We built a good raft
together, and he watched me safely over and until
I was out of sight in the trees.  Then I took
down my "notice" and hit the trail for Gold
Run.  George Earsman, living in the first cabin
I came to on that creek, was a sympathetic
listener while I told of the strange meeting.  But
he could not forbear humorously remarking
that I had in a sense, "turned the tables" on my
brother.  Back in Gait, he said, no doubt James
had often put me to sleep, and when next we met
I was trying to put him to sleep!
</p>

<p>
I saw my brother only once more.  Ed. Blanchfield
brought me a letter from Dawson
some weeks after marked "urgent."  It was from
Jim, stating that orders had been received
requiring him to leave the Yukon for Police
headquarters at Regina, Saskatchewan.  He had to
take the first up-river boat, the <i>Casca</i>, which
sailed the next day.  I made record time over
the twenty miles from Gold Bottom next
morning.  John came in nine miles from Bonanza,
and I spent a happy afternoon with my two "big"
brothers before the steamboat pulled away for
the south.
</p>

<p>
After those many strenuous years serving
Canada in wild and dangerous days on the
prairies, and among the forests and mountains
of the northland, he now takes his rest.  His is
a lonely grave near one of the outposts of settlement
on the northern reaches of our prairies.

<h3>
<i>VIII.</i>
<br /><br />
<i>Ben</i>
</h3>

<p>
One of the pluckiest deeds I have ever seen
done by any airman I witnessed in 1918
on the Mericourt front.  On a line two or three
miles behind us, and stretching roughly from
Arras along Vimy Ridge to the Souchez valley,
we had our usual complement of observation
balloons.  These were held by long wire cables and
contained two observers each.
</p>

<p>
One fine clear day five of these balloons were
up, high in the air, watching movements behind
the German lines.  Macpherson and I were
tramping along through one of our deep
communication trenches on some errand, when the
sound of distant, anti-aircraft shells bursting in
the air, reached our ears.  We climbed out at
the Beehive dug-out to see what was up.  Far
above the balloon nearest Arras there was
appearing, against the blue sky, many little white
clouds of smoke caused by exploding shrapnel,
while near the ground we saw two open
parachutes descending, the observers had "jumped
for it."  From the smoke above there emerged
an aeroplane darting straight down on the balloon.
Almost quicker than I can tell it, a volley
of incendiary bullets from the plane had ignited
the big bag, and it fell to the earth like a twisted
torch in smoke and flame.
</p>

<p>
The German never swerved, but headed away
for the next balloon.  The observers from that
one by this time were nearing the ground under
their parachutes, and in a few minutes the
observers of all five were either on the ground,
or floating gracefully to the earth beneath their
big "umbrellas," seeking safety from this nervy
Hun.  By this time everything along the Ridge
that could reach him was turned loose.  There
was a perfect storm of shrapnel, machine-gun
and rifle-fire.  Hundreds of shells exploded
around him and thousands of bullets sped
towards him, and it seemed impossible that he
could continue.  But he didn't even try to escape.
He went right on through that deadly fusilade,
courting death every second, until he had
reached the Souchez and had burned every one
of our five balloons.  Then and not till then,
did he turn towards Hun-land.
</p>

<p>
In spite of our irritation at his complete
success, we could not deny the pilot's great bravery.
The recognition of his courage was heartier
because he really put none of our men in actual
jeopardy, although he offered himself and his
machine-gunner as an absurdly easy target to
our guns throughout the whole affair.  No doubt
his mate, he himself, and the plane were hit a
good many times but not enough to bring them
down or stop their work.  In all probability the
plane would have to go to the repair sheds and
the men into hospital after they landed.
</p>

<p>
The whole show, which we had seen clearly
from start to finish, was over in ten minutes, and
we went down to tell the fellows in the dug-out
what we had just seen.  The description called
up memories of other deeds of bravery, and some
stirring stories were told.  I offered one about
my dog Ben who, I claimed, had a place by
right in the world's list of heroes.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
It is hard to believe that dogs do not think
along much the same lines as we do in the
simpler relations of life.  I find it impossible to
disbelieve in affection existing between dogs and
men, and in a marvellous readiness on the part of
the dog to go the whole way in laying down its
life for the man it loves.  I do not know how to
interpret their actions otherwise.
</p>

<p>
One winter, among my dogs I had a half-mastiff,
half-wolf, that I had raised from a pup.
He was my favorite, a big, awkward,
good-natured fellow who wanted to follow me
everywhere, and when I left him at home would cry,
in his own way, with vexation.  He would go
wild with joy when I returned.  He also seemed
to take upon himself the guarding of the cabin.
Strangers might come and go for all the others
cared, but Ben would always stop every man he
didn't know at the cabin door, not in an ugly or
noisy way, but as a matter of duty, until I opened
the door and welcomed the stranger in.  He
never interfered with those who had been once
admitted to the cabin should they come again,
noticing them only to give a friendly whine and
wag of the tail.  I suppose you can all match my
story thus far, but let me go on.
</p>

<p>
One hard winter in the Yukon, when the snow
was very deep on the hills, and there had been
a prolonged spell of unusually extreme frost,
the wolves commenced to come down at night
into the valleys close to the cabins to hunt and
devour stray dogs, or anything else they could
get.  One night I was roused from sleep by the
very unpleasant noise of a howling, snarling,
wolf-pack fighting over something not far from
my cabin.  I wrapped my fur robe hastily about
me, and opening the door peered out.  They
were gathered in a circle round what was
apparently a crippled wolf, doing it to death.  I
shut the door and hurried into my clothes.  I
wanted to have a shot at them, for there was a
bounty on wolves, and their furs were worth
something.
</p>

<p>
As I slipped out of the door after dressing,
it occurred to me to see if my dogs were secure
under cover.  They were whining and uneasy,
but I found them wisely keeping safe in their
stout log kennels, all but one of them.  Ben's
kennel was empty.
</p>

<p>
Instantly I knew what the brave young dog
had done.  Here was a band of strangers,
suspicious looking characters, coming towards the
cabin.  He went out to meet them alone.  He
must have known by instinct, as the others did,
that savage death would meet him in those dim,
gray, howling forms.  Maybe he trembled with
fear, but he went out for my protection to
engage in a hopeless fight against a pack of
ravenous timber-wolves.
</p>

<p>
Immediately I grasped the situation I fired at
the edge of the pack.  They commenced to run,
disappearing like ghosts in the moonlight on the
white mountain-side, but not before I got two of
them.  Poor Ben was badly torn.  I carried him
in my arms into the cabin, lit the fire, and in the
candle-light dressed the great, tearing gashes.
A few minutes more and they would have had
him killed and eaten.
</p>

<p>
For two days I worked as best I knew to save
his life.  But he was suffering agony, and at last
I decided it would be more merciful to put an
end to his pain by having him shot.  I went up
to the N.W.M.P. Post and got Corp. "Paddy"
Ryan to come and do it for me.  We carried him
a little distance from the cabin, and laid him at
the side of the trail.  I confess I turned my head
away while Ryan shot.  Ben rolled down the hill
a few yards through the snow, until he stopped
against a bush.  We watched to see if there was
any move.  "He is dead," we said, but to be sure
I gave my whistle.  For a minute nothing happened,
and then I saw his faithful, battered head
moving up very slowly out of the snow, and
swaying to and fro.  Ryan shot again.  Ben's
head dropped and he died.
</p>

<p>
I think I did what was best in the circumstances,
and maybe I'm imagining motives that
weren't there, but all the same there comes an
ache in my heart whenever I remember that last
shot.  In his death-throes, blind and broken, his
controlling impulse was to come to me when I
whistled.  Perhaps he thought I needed him.
I believe there are dogs in heaven.  Because the
Bible says there are dogs kept out, it is not
accurate exegesis to assume that there are none
let in.  And if I meet Ben I feel as if I'll have to
try to explain it all and ask forgiveness.  But I
don't think he will bear any grudge.  He was
too big-hearted for that.  I gave him a good
grave on the hillside near my cabin door.  It was
all I could do for him then.

<i>IX.</i>
<br /><br />
<i>A Trail Sermon</i>
</h3>

<p>
In October, 1917, orders came to join in the
big push on the Flanders front in what
proved a vain attempt to cut the enemy lines of
communication with the Belgian coast held by
the Germans and used as a resort for submarines.
The Canadians were asked to take Passchendaele
Ridge which rose abruptly about 300 feet above
the miles of mud flats its guns dominated.  These
muddy fields had been captured by Australians
and New Zealanders after desperate fighting,
but it was almost impossible to hold them
without terrible punishment from the concentrated
German artillery fire, bombing, and machine-gunning
because of the enemy's position on the
Ridge.  No trenches could be made in the mud
for the sides would slip back in, and there was
practically no protection for our men outside the
few small concrete blockhouses or "pill boxes"
the Huns had built.  So we had either to withdraw
or go on and chase the enemy off the Ridge.
</p>

<p>
The 9th brigade of the famous Third
Canadian division was chosen for the post of honour.
This was the task of capturing the almost
unassailable German positions on Bellevue Spur
which was a part of the Passchendaele heights
lying immediately in front of us.  Of the brigade,
the 43rd battalion (the "Camerons" of
Winnipeg) and 58th were to make the attack, with
the 52nd in close support.  The 116th, junior
battalion of the brigade, was employed as a
labour battalion, and a dirty, dangerous job they
had, "packing" ammunition and "duck-walks"
at night through the mud up to the attack area,
doing pick-and-shovel work, and afterwards
carrying back wounded men under shell-fire.
</p>

<p>
Friday, October 26th, was the fateful day.
Someone suggested that Friday was unlucky and
26 was twice 13, but this was countered by the
seven letters in October and the lucky number
at the end of 1917!  It wasn't luck in sevens or
thirteens that won the battle, but simply that we
had men and officers with an unyielding
determination to carry on in spite of all obstacles,
unless wounded or killed, until their objective was
gained.  Contributing causes there were in
training, equipment, and leadership that helped
our men to do the impossible, but the deciding
factor, the real cause of victory, lay in the brave
hearts of the soldiers who faced the Spur that
chill October morning.
</p>

<p>
The ground had been reconnoitred by Lt.-Col. Grassie,
our O.C., who had to leave for Canada
before the attack took place.  Our operations
were carried out under the skilful direction of
Major Chandler.
</p>

<p>
In one of my old note-books I find a description
of the affair scribbled Oct. 27th during a
leisure moment in Waterloo pill-box.  "From
Banks Farm we moved up to within striking
distance of Bellevue Spur taking over from a
battalion of Wellington New Zealanders.
Headquarters occupied the concrete blockhouse near
the foot of the spur and about 400 yards away
from the enemy lines.  We were under direct
machine-gun fire and sniping from their posts
on the crest of the hill we had to capture.  Our
blockhouse was continually shelled.  The enemy
guns had its location to a nicety and kept it under
almost constant fire.  Twelve men in all were
killed at the door at different times during the
few days we stayed there.
</p>

<p>
"In the attack yesterday morning, fifty of our
men in the centre were able to make and hold
their objective, but the battalion on our right
was forced to fall back to the edge of the hill
after being exposed to a fire which cut it down
to ineffective strength.  One of our companies
on the left ran into a murderous fire from
a group of German posts opposed to them.  We
withdrew to the brow of the hill and sent word
back for re-inforcements.  Our centre still held
but their position was precarious and before
nightfall would have become untenable if these
Germans to their left were not dislodged.  The
52nd were ordered to reinforce our left wing
and renew the attack.  This time we were
successful, 150 prisoners were captured in
half-an-hour and the whole front cleared.  The 58th
were enabled to advance and we had no further
trouble in consolidating our position."
</p>

<p>
Two V.C's were won that day.  Bobby Shankland,
a subaltern in the 43rd, under enemy
observation with its consequent machine-gun and
rifle fire, made the trip from one of our advanced
platoons back to battalion headquarters and
out to his men again.  He brought accurate
information at a critical time when prompt action
properly directed meant victory; the lack of it
meant defeat.  The renewed attack on the left
wing with the definite objective he advised saved
the day for us.  He was recommended for the
highest award and it was duly awarded him.
Lt. O'Kelly of the 52nd won the coveted honor
by the gallant and effective way in which,
regardless of personal risk, he led a company of
the 52nd against a group of pill-boxes filled with
machine-gunners.
</p>

<p>
Many other gallant deeds were done on the
hill that day of which there was no one left to
tell.
</p>

<p>
During this time a stream of wounded had
been coming back past Waterloo Pill-box where
our battalion Medical Aid Post was at work.
The floor of the blockhouse was a foot deep in
mud and water.  The stretchers were almost
submerged and the back of the man was almost
always in the water.  At times the stretcher-cases
were lying in three rows outside in the
cold, the rain, and the mud.  There they were
constantly in danger of death from shelling.
Twice shells burst among them, killing and
wounding again a dozen men on each occasion.
Half the cases never got into the dressing station.
They were given a look-over, fixed up as well
as we could, and sent hobbling off over the
"duck-walks" to safer areas farther back.  Only
the most severe cases were held for the attention
of the overworked M.O.  The long stretcher
journeys to the rear were terrible experiences
for both bearers and wounded.  They had to
pass through shelling, gas, and bombing.  The
carrying parties often became stretcher cases
themselves on the way back, and the wounded in
that rough journey must have suffered tortures
of both mind and body.
</p>

<p>
The outstanding memory of it all is that of
the mud.  It would seem impossible for a
sensible man to develop a bitter hatred towards an
inanimate and apparently harmless thing like
mud.  But it was "the very devil" to our minds.
We walked in it for endless miles.  It held our
feet and wore us out.  If you fell sideways you
would probably break or sprain your ankle.  We
sat down in the mud, slept in it, fought in it.
It clogged our rifles and machine-guns.  We
cursed it with intensity.  We ate rations that
tasted of mud, wore clothes that were loaded
with it, carried with aching muscles stretchers
and wounded that were made heavy with mud.
Many wounded were lost in it, and many of our
dead, that we never found, were swallowed by
it.  Hindenburg in his memoirs considers
Passchendaele the most terrible affair his armies
had anywhere engaged in.  It was bad for them
but it was worse for us attacking, and the thing
that made conditions almost unbearable for both
sides was that omnipresent vampire of those
rain-soaked Flanders' fields.
</p>

<p>
On the 28th we were relieved and moved back
and, in a day or two, found ourselves in tents in
the mud of a ploughed field near Nine Elms
back of Poperinghe.  We had done nobly, so
they told us, added fresh laurels to our fine
record, fought a fight and won a victory, the
praises of which would resound throughout the
Empire.  Needless to say we were glad we had
not failed but for all that there was much
unspoken sorrow in the men's hearts.  So many
of our comrades had been killed.  What a
remnant our 100 men looked when the battalion
paraded to hear some fine words of heartsome
praise from our brigade commander, Gen. Hill.
</p>

<p>
On the Sunday morning we had a parade service.
It lasted altogether only fifteen minutes.
It was a prayer for the mourners at home, a
hymn of thanksgiving, and a word of cheer to
ourselves.  Towards evening Sergt-Major Lowe
told me that some of the men wanted me to come
over and talk to them.  In one of the tents, I
found thirty or so crowded in to hear a story of
the Yukon, and in the tents close around others
were listening as I talked.  We were all in a
serious mood, and somehow the consciousness of
this influenced me, that night, to weave my
stories into a message in which there would be
comfort and cheer for men who had been hard hit,
and had faced in roughest form the stern realities
of life, and death, and suffering.  There was
help in it, I know, because I spoke of Jesus of
Nazareth.  When you want to minister to men
in such times, don't your thoughts just naturally
turn to the Man of Nazareth?  So I spoke of
Him and clothed my message in Klondike
phrases and imagery.  Here it is very much as
I gave it that evening at Nine Elms.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
We are all feeling a little bit down these days.
The savagery of war and our heavy losses in
men we knew and loved has stirred deep
thoughts in us, grave inner questionings why
these things should be, perplexing difficulties
about the meaning of life and the power of
death, the reason of suffering and the goodness
of a God who permits it, criticisms of a social
order, nominally Christian, which produces the
barbarities we have witnessed and taken part in.
We are groping for light like the blind, and
wishing we could find a sure guide in our thinking
on these tangled problems, in whose solution
we might find satisfaction and assurance.
</p>

<p>
There is one song of all our soldier-songs that
I think will live and that is the one where we
sing of "a long, long trail a-winding into the
land of our dreams."  There's something true
to experience about the thought of the long road
of life.  It takes me back to old trail days in the
North, and I picture the long, long, trail of life
winding its way from out of the mists of the past,
through pleasant valleys and over windswept
mountain summits, on and on into the unexplored
land of the future.  My message is simple
enough.  It is an appeal straight from your
padre's heart that in your sorrow and uncertainty
you decide to take Jesus of Nazareth as your
guide down the trail of life for all the days that
are to come.  I ask you to follow Him because
He is the very guide you need to find the right
trail and keep it under your feet to the end.
Life is all we've got and it is therefore too
precious to risk in any unnecessary way.  It is
so important that we find and keep the right
trail and save our lives from spiritual death, we
cannot afford to accept any guide who has not
the very finest credentials.  What are the
credentials of Christ when He offers himself as our
Guide?  They may be spoken of in many ways,
but I am going reverently to put him to the three
tests any guide in the Yukon would have to face
before he could qualify to lead anyone on a
mid-winter trip into new country over an
unknown trail beset with dangers.
</p>

<p>
But before I can get to this examination of
His credentials I know many of you are mentally
stumbling over difficulties you have with
or about the Bible.  It has been said with much
truth that "the Bible has kept many an earnest
man from Christ."  It is not going to do it with
you if I can prevent it.  I have heard you
wondering about the truth of the Garden of Eden
story, about a God who hardened Pharaoh's
heart so that he could slay the first-born of all
the Egyptians, the story of Jonah and the fish,
the difficulties of accepting Biblical science and
history, the miracles, and such like things, and
when you all have given your special stumbling-blocks
I could probably add some of mine that
you hadn't thought of.  I am not going to
attempt just now to deny or remove any of these
particular difficulties but show you a way round
them, a right way of approach to the Bible, so
that instead of keeping you from Christ it can
fulfill its divine mission of revealing Him.
</p>

<p>
I had a partner with me for one winter in my
log-cabin at Gold Bottom, way in the Klondike
hills.  His name was Jack Crowe, a Nova
Scotian, who had come out from Dawson to teach
the little school we had started for the dozen
children on the creek.  We took turns at
cooking.  One winter morning, the mercury clear out
of sight in the bulb of our thermometer, it was
my turn to get out and light the fire and make
breakfast.  This consisted principally of
oatmeal porridge, bacon, bread of our own make,
and coffee.  There were two big bowls of
porridge with nothing left in the pot.  We sat
down, asked a blessing, and commenced our
breakfast.  The first spoonful I took my teeth
struck on something hard.  It wasn't porridge
and I took it out of my mouth.  It was a button.
What did I do?  Throw my bowlful of porridge
away and do without half a breakfast on
account of that button which I couldn't
swallow?  No, I did just what you or any other
ordinary man would have done.  I placed the
button beside my plate and ate the porridge with
relish, and I think if there had been twenty-five
buttons in that porridge I'd have done the same,
an odd button or two out of place wasn't going
to deprive me of my needed breakfast.  Fifty
below zero makes you too hungry to be
fastidious.  Further, let me take you into my
confidence, I found the place where that button
belonged before the day was over, sewed it on, and
it did good service.
</p>

<p>
Of course you see my point.  I don't blink the
difficulties in our thinking about the Bible.
They exist.  Most of them can be explained
when we study the subject a bit, some few are
still half-solved puzzles to me which I enjoy
working at when I have leisure, and some I
suppose I shall never quite see through; but just
let us lay them all aside for the time being and
go straight to bed-rock and see if there is gold in
the claim of Christ himself.  You know, by the
way, it is strange how what at one time we
thought useless material in the Bible finds its
place as we gain more experience of life.  When
I was very young the psalms seemed almost
meaningless.  Now some of them voice the
deepest longings of my soul for I have learned
the bitterness of life as well as its sweetness.
The minor prophets at the end of the Old
Testament seemed to be "cumberers of the ground"
until I learned something of the crookedness of
present day politics, the prevalence of the cancer
of sanctimonious hypocrisy, and the power of
Mammon-worship to obstruct social reforms
long overdue.  Then it seemed that a book like
Amos was not only up-to-date, but far ahead of
us.  There are passages in the fifth chapter that
should be painted in giant letters on the walls of
legislatures, in halls of justice, in the
market-place, and above the pulpits of Christendom.
</p>

<p>
But leave your lesser problems unsolved for
the time and get the first, biggest question settled
as to the validity of Christ's claim to be able to
guide us safely through life.
</p>

<p>
In the old stampede days up there, and it's the
same still, the first qualification demanded in a
guide was that he should know the trail.  It
was impossible to talk business on any other
basis.  Every other virtue your would-be guide
possessed would be useless without that essential
one.  Christ is prepared to stand that test, make
it as "acid" as you like.  How can we test Him
when we do not ourselves know the way?  We
all have a God-given intuition by which we can
tell that the direction the guide would have us
go is right or wrong.  Even a Canadian who had
never been in Scotland and wanted to go there
would have "horse-sense" enough not to follow
a man who offered to take him to Edinburgh by
going five thousand miles due West from
Halifax.
</p>

<p>
So with Christ.  He asks no blind faith or
sanctified superstition.  What direction would
He lead us?  What is the great burden of His
message accepted by all Christian Churches
down underneath the load of dogma, form and
ceremony?  Where would He lead us if we
followed Him?  The road is marked by two parallel
lines, the eternal boundaries of the Christ
trail, on the one side it is heart-righteousness
and on the other brotherly kindness; and to show
us what He meant, He walked that trail Himself
His life through.  It's a great thing to have
a guide who knows the trail not only "on the
map" but has been over every bit of it and knows
it perfectly.  He shows by His own life just what
He means, the heart right as His was right, and
a brotherly-kindness that gladly lays down its
life to help others.  Doesn't it seem to you to
be the right direction, the right trail, the right
guide?
</p>

<p>
This seems to me like trying to prove an
axiom.  You can't prove it by process of logic.
To state it is to prove it.  We know by intuition
it is right and it is the only trail.  Take the
fundamental need of heart-rightness.  It is the heart
of man in which evil dwells.  The cruel ambition
that permitted this war originated in the
hearts of a group of men.  The greed for money
that refuses to permit social iniquities to be
removed has its habitation in men's <i>hearts</i>.  The
whole horrid brood whose mother is selfishness
exists only in men's <i>hearts</i>.  "<i>Out of the heart</i>"
Christ said, evil comes.  Cleanse the heart and
you clean the world.  But you can't have your
heart right the way Christ teaches unless you
have a place in it for your brother.  A Christian
must be and will be deeply interested in Social
Reform.  You can't follow Christ and forget
your brother, for the trail of Christ is the trail of
self-sacrifice for others.  Christ then knows the
right trail which would lead you and me and the
whole world unto a happier, sweeter day.  I
know no other way that so completely satisfies
my sense of what is right and true as the way of
Christ.
</p>

<p>
The second test of the worth of a guide,
after I was satisfied that he knew the way, was
whether he was able and willing to help me
when I got into difficulties in hard places.  The
trail leads dizzily round the mountain side with
a precipice below.  I'm a tenderfoot.  I have
neither the nerve nor skill to take my dogs and
my sleigh safely past.  I'd fall to my death surely
if I attempt it.  He tells me it's the only way
through, and he is right.  I say I can't make it.
He replies that all he offered to do was to lead
along the right trail.  It is up to me to follow.
Or the mountain climb is so steep and the snow
so deep that I haven't strength for it.  Again I
appeal to this imaginary guide.  He says it is
not his business to do anything more than
walk ahead and show me the way.  But I
can't follow him and I know to camp on the
mountain-side means death.  No matter what
perfect knowledge such a guide would have
it would mean tragedy for me unless he had
more than knowledge.  But there is no guide,
white, Eskimo, or Siwash, that I have ever
met would act that way.  He would take his
own dogs round the mountain then come
back and, with expert strength, take me safely
past the danger.  He would help me somehow
to make the steep grade.
</p>

<p>
So on the trail of life there are the towering
mountains of sin.  They lie across the right
trail in every man's life.  We are all sinners.
You remember how Christ once dispersed a
mob.  He said, "Let him that is without sin cast
the first stone," and while He wrote on the
ground they all took the chance, as we would
have done, to sneak away self-condemned.
Well, no man can cleanse his own heart of sin
and yet no true man can rest content in sin.  It
must be done and no human power can do it.
If we are to get past the mountains of our sins,
and we must get past them or die, then our
guide must be able to get us over.  That's why
we need a Saviour.  It meant Gethsemane and
Calvary to him.  It is the Atonement, and whatever
varying interpretations it may have, it must
ever mean that the Guide is also a Saviour.  He
is getting us safe across to the God-ward side of
our sins.  They are no longer in our way if we
will but give ourselves to Him to take us over.
No longer are they a barrier between ourselves
and God as we journey on.  Before we reach the
land of gold which we pilgrims are seeking, we
also come to the dark valley and mystery of
death.  Can He find a safe way for our feet in
the darkness?  Will He leave us to follow when
we cannot see him?  Not He.  He found His
own way safely through&mdash;that's the meaning of
His empty tomb&mdash;and He guarantees to hold us
securely in that strange experience at the end of
the trail till, going on, we make through the fog
into the land beyond, and see the golden city of
God.  Our guide is stronger than sin and death.
</p>

<p>
There is another test.  My guide must not
only know the trail and be able to get me through
safely but he must be one with whom I can talk.
Men used to go crazy in the North through
sheer loneliness.  Days alone on the trail with
your dogs amid the deep silences of the
sub-arctics makes you hungry for conversation with
some other human being.  I have turned ten
miles out of my way on a heavy trail simply to
get to some trapper or prospector where I might
hear "the sweet music of speech."  I remember
having as a guide on a three weeks trip to the
Lightning Creek Camp an Indian who was of
the conventional silent type.  He knew the
trail and his duties perfectly.  I had only one
fault to find with him.  He wouldn't or couldn't
chat with me in either English or Chinook.  I
paid him off at Lightning.  I couldn't stand it
any longer.  I hired another man for the return
trip, not such a capable guide, but one with
whom I could have a little chat around the camp
fire in the evenings.
</p>

<p>
It is just like that on the trail of life.  Many
times we ache to unburden our hearts to someone
who will hear and understand and speak comforting
words to us.  Our dearest earthly friends
can't quite enter into the intimate sanctuaries of
a man's life.  There are many lonely places on
our journey when heart and soul cry out for that
companionship that none can give but Jesus of
Nazareth.  "Comfortable words He speaketh,
while his hands uphold and guide."
</p>

<p>
He is my guide and I cannot do without Him.
I would lose my life in the wilderness if He
should leave me to fend for myself.  I have utter
confidence in Him.  As I come to know Him
better my faith grows stronger.  At the end of
the trail, if I have time to think, I shall have
many regrets as I look back, but I know there is
one thing I shall never regret and that is that
long ago I placed myself in the hands of Jesus
Christ for good and all.

<i>How Cheechaco Hill was Named</i>
</h3>

<p>
The war did the work of a can-opener on
many national and individual reputations,
and discovered that their accepted labels were
misleading.  The estimates we had formed of
certain nations have materially changed because
of the part they took, didn't take, or were slow
about taking in this world-crisis.  We saw the
effect more clearly on individuals.  The standing
a man had in his community might be taken
at its face value in the battalion for a few weeks,
but he was soon re-examined, and if necessary,
the label changed to be true to contents.  This
was especially evident overseas when we were
away from home and its influences.  There is a
camouflage possible in civilian life where a
man's real self is not known much outside his
own home.  This camouflage was usually torn
aside in the army.  We were thrown into such
continuous intimate relations with one another
in the huts and outside them that there was little
chance for any man to travel under false
pretences.  It wasn't many days before you were
sized up physically, mentally, and morally.  The
O.C., Adjutant, and senior officers were the only
ones in a battalion having more privacy and
protected by military etiquette who, if they
wished, might wear a mask for a time, but not
for long.  The whole battalion somehow soon
got to know pretty much all about them, or
thought it knew, and labelled them accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Some men with fair reputations in their home
town in Canada were found in rare instances
to be cads in camp and curs in the line.  But
to the honor of those of the old British stock,
our own Canadian men in particular, the great
fear in the hearts of multitudes of them was that
they might not be able to do or be all that the
highest traditions of race or family expected of
them.  They came from the comfort of peaceful
homes where war had meant only an old, foolish,
long-abandoned way of settling international
disputes.  At the call of brotherhood, they left
those quiet homes and came in their hundreds
of thousands to the old lands across the sea.
There, in training, they were surrounded with
strange conditions of life, and when later they
went into the line were faced with tasks of
incredible difficulty and harshness.  Throughout
the long years of war they were rarely
disconcerted and never dismayed.  Most of them were
just good, ordinary, Canadian boys, practically
untested until now, but in tribulation developing
qualities that made them men "whom the King
delighted to honor."  Labelled, if you like,
"plum-and-apple," when opened up they proved
to be genuine "strawberry."  Faithful comrades,
brave soldiers, they played the new game so
nobly and well during those weary, homesick,
war-cursed years that they won for Canada a
name unsurpassed in honor among the nations.
</p>

<p>
It was not so much the grand moment of an
attack that revealed character but the strain and
monotony of the common round of a soldier's
life.  It was the pack, the trenches, the mud, the
dug-out, and the hut, that showed you up for
what you really were.  When you got a fruitcake
from home did you "hog it" all yourself
or share it with your chums in generous chunks?
Did you squeeze in near the stove on a cold day
no matter who else was shoved away?  Did you
barely do your routine duty or go further and
lend a helping hand?  These were the sort of
tests in common-place forms that made it
impossible to hide your own true self from the other
fellows.  If you asked me for instances I could
fill a page with names from my own acquaintance
of young chaps previously untried who
proved themselves "gentlemen unafraid."
</p>

<p>
It was a severe test for the young men, but
peculiarly hard for those in our volunteer army
who were middle-aged.  With habits formed
and living a settled life at home, they abandoned
it cheerfully, and unflinchingly set about
accommodating themselves in the most unselfish spirit
to necessary campaign conditions, which must
have been to them almost intolerable.
</p>

<p>
In this condition I have in mind Captain
Turner, Medical Officer to the 43rd Battalion
for six months.  He was a man near fifty years
of age, with wife and family left behind at home
in a Western Ontario town.  "Doc" Turner
joined us at Nine Elms, where we were resting
in the mud after our attack on Bellevue Spur.
He came direct from the base and had never
seen any front line work.  It was customary for
the M.O. and the Padre to live together and
work together in and out of the line, so he shared
a tent with me.  A few days after his arrival we
moved into the line for the second time on the
Passchendaele front.  It was on the evening
before this move that he did me a service that I
shall never forget.  He "saved my face" in the
battalion.  This is how it came about.  That
afternoon I sat in my chilly tent writing some of
the many letters which I had to write to folks
at home, telling about their heroic dead.
Captain Turner had gone over to Poperinghe.  I sat
too long at my work and got chilled through.
After supper I was feeling wretched and went
to bed hoping that a few hours warmth and rest
would cure me.  I got worse, and about 10
o'clock to cap the climax, when I was feeling
very miserable, a runner came from the orderly
room with the news that we were to pull out for
the line next morning, breakfast at five and move
at six.  Then the horrible thought came to me
that perhaps I wouldn't be able to go with the
battalion.  If I weren't a great deal better by
morning I would have to stay behind in a C.C.S. at
Remy.  What then would everybody think?
It looked queer that I should be going around
quite well that day and then, when the order
comes to go back into the line, I take suddenly
ill.  I knew my own boys would say nothing,
but perhaps in the back of their minds they
would wonder if their padre was really scared.
But no matter how charitable the Camerons
were it would look to outsiders deplorably like
a genuine case of malingering.  My one and only
hope seemed to lie in the magic of Doc's
medicines.  "As I mused the fire burned."  He had
not returned and the medical tent was a hundred
yards away in the mud.  How anxiously I
listened for his footsteps but it was one o'clock
before I heard the welcome sound.  He was
very tired with the six-mile walk and busy day
and after I told what the orders were I hadn't
the heart at first to let him know how sick and
worried I was.  He had taken off one boot
before in desperation I poured out my tale of woe.
Good old Doc!  He cheerfully pulled on his
wet boot again and went out into the night and
rain and through the mud, roused Sergt. Sims
and hunted around till he got the stuff he
wanted.  He was soon back and made me
swallow fifteen grains of aspirin.  I would have
swallowed an earthquake if he had promised it
would cure me.  Then he piled his greatcoat and
one of his own blankets on me.  Enough to say
I was clear of the fever in the morning and
devoutly thankful that, although a little shaky, I
was able to form up with the rest at six o'clock.
</p>

<p>
Doc played the game just like that all through
his first spell in the line.  Often I wondered at
the matter-of-fact way he carried on like "an old
hand" under conditions which were bad enough
in all conscience to everyone, but must have been
doubly so to him.  But if the real stuff is in a
man it will show up "under fire" some day, and
Captain Turner is only typical of thousands of
uncertain-looking "prospects" that assayed
almost pure gold in the crucible of war.  When
our turn was over and the welcome news came
to move back to divisional rest, Doc and I
travelled out together with two or three of the
boys.  We had about five miles to go and the
Hun artillery seemed to be chasing us with his
shells.  They dropped just behind us with
uncanny precision for a mile or two blowing up the
slat duck-walks we had come over.  I was in the
lead and because of "the general scarcity of good
men" I was hitting a fast pace.  At last I heard
him call out, "Hold on, padre, I can't keep this
pace any longer.  They can blow me to Kingdom-come
if they like but I'm going to slow up
whatever happens."  Strange, too, that slowing
up saved our lives, for a few minutes after we
were stopped by a salvo of shells ahead of us
bursting where we would have been if Doc
hadn't put on the brakes.
</p>

<p>
The battalion moved far back to the sleepy
little farming village of Westerhem where one
day Captain Ross, of the Y.M.C.A. sent a request
to come over and give a Klondike talk to the men
in a neighbouring town.  That evening they
filled the big marquee and stayed for over an
hour while I told them how Cheechaco Hill
got its name.  It is a story with a moral and has
a logical connection with my prologue.  What
that is I think you will have little difficulty in
discovering if you read the story.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The creek names of the Klondike are filled
with the romance of the early days.  They tell
in large something of the story of the pioneer.
The names all have color.  They speak of
incident and adventure, of hopefulness and
disappointment, of loneliness and homesickness.
There's Dominion Creek and Fourth of July
Creek.  You hardly need be told that a Canadian
"discovered" one and a Yankee the other.
"Whisky Hill," "Squabblers' Bench," "Paradise
Hill" has each a story of its own and the names
hint at it.  Mastodon Gulch with its remains of
bone and ivory found in the ever-frozen gravels
takes us back to the giant Tuskers of those
prehistoric ages before the northland was gripped
by the frost.  Bear Creek suggests an adventure
resulting perhaps in a juicy bear-steak or a
hurried scramble up a tree.  All Gold Creek, Too
Much Gold, and Gold Bottom have the optimism
of their discoverers boldly disclosed.  Of
these three only the last paid to work.  I asked
Bob Henderson, from Pictou County, Nova
Scotia, the discoverer of the Klondike
Gold-fields, why he chose the name "Gold Bottom."  "On
the principle," he said, "that it's wise to
give a youngster a good name to inspire him to
live up to it.  I had a day-dream, you know,
that when I got my shaft down to bed-rock it
might be like the streets of the New Jerusalem.
We old-timers all had these dreams.  It kept us
going on and on, wandering, and digging on
these lonely creeks for years."  Last Chance
Creek has a story of its own and sometime I may
tell you what I know of it.  It entered Hunker
Creek about fifteen miles back of Dawson.  In
the rush days a roadhouse was put up there and
named after the Creek.  Later it was assumed
that the creek was named after the roadhouse
and that the roadhouse got its name because it
was the last chance to get a drink outward bound
on that trail!
</p>

<p>
But I must get to my story of Cheechaco Hill.
There are two words in common use in the
Yukon, one is Sourdough and the other Cheechaco.
A sourdough is an old-timer, cheechaco
is a Chinook word meaning greenhorn, tenderfoot,
or new-comer.  In every old prospector's
cabin on a shelf behind the stove-pipe you would
see a bowl which contained sour dough from the
previous baking.  This was used as yeast to be
mixed in with the dough at the next baking.
When he used any he would always replace it
with the same quantity of fresh dough sure to
be soured before he made bread again.  The
cheechaco had to learn how to bake and usually
would borrow some of this yeast-dough from
some old-timer down the trail until he had his
own sour-dough and so earned his graduate
title.  Now for my story.
</p>

<p>
In the winter following the discovery of the
Klondike diggings, two Australians were sitting
in their cabin on Bonanza Creek at No. 5 below
Discovery, having a smoke after a hard day's
grind down the drift and on the windlass.  One
of them was telling with great relish of a
practical joke he had played that day on two
cheechacos.  The winter trail in the creek valley ran
close on their shaft.  That afternoon two men,
evidently partners, hauling their outfit and
sleigh had stopped for a rest and one of them
had climbed up the dump to the windlass and,
after a word or two of greeting, commenced to
tell their difficulties.  They wanted to find some
place to put in their stakes, "open" ground that
they could "claim" for their own on which to
prospect.  They had come seven miles up the
creek and there seemed to be nothing open.
They asked the Australian if he could tell them
where they could stake.  This question revealed
them as the most verdant of cheechacos, for if
you knew of any unstaked ground likely to have
paydirt in it you weren't going to give your
information to a stranger.  You or your partner
would slip away quietly after dark.  You would
carefully endeavour to conceal your movements
until you had the ground securely staked and
recorded.  Even then any information you might
have would only be given to other friends.  So
of course he told the strangers he could not help
them.
</p>

<p>
The cheechaco then asked him if it would be
any use staking on the mountain side, overlooking
the creek.  This was too much for the old-timer
for everyone with any sense knows that
alluvial gold can't climb a hill.  It was a natural
law that the heaviest substances always seek the
lowest levels.  Gold was no exception to this
rule.  You find it in bed-rock in the valleys
where it has burrowed its way down whenever
a run of water has loosened things up and given
it a chance.  So the Australian couldn't resist
the temptation to agree that there was lots of
room on the mountain-side, plenty of trees,
they'd be above the frost-fog and "nearer
heaven" than in the creeks.  They took the
thing seriously, asked a few more questions
about correct methods of staking and recording
and then went on their way.  It was a right good
joke and such green specimens were certainly
proper game; somebody would put them wise
up at the Forks anyway, and the two had a
hearty laugh over the incident.
</p>

<p>
A day or two afterwards they saw a small
tent and the smoke of a fire on the hill opposite,
sure enough the cheechacos had "bit."  They
had staked two claims, a "bench" and a
"hillside" adjoining, and were cutting wood and
hauling moss for a cabin.  The news spread
along Bonanza until all the creek knew about it
and laughed.  The two men didn't sense
anything wrong and looked upon the Australians
as their friends.  They often came down to the
cabin to get advice about building their cabin,
how to fit the corners, what size to make it,
where to get the moss for the roof and chinking
between the logs in the walls.  They needed
pointers about cooking and a supply of sourdough
for their first batch of bread.  Apart from
their ignorance of frontier ways, they were right
good fellows.  One came from England, the
other, Nels Peterson, from Sweden.  They had
fallen in with one another in Seattle when they
happened to be outfitting in the same store, there
they had spoken to one another, got acquainted,
and agreed to go north as partners.  One was a
professional Swedish music-hall comedian and
the other a London "cabby" with a witty tongue
and a kind heart.  Such were the strange
partnerships of the Klondike.
</p>

<p>
In a few weeks the cabin was completed, seven
feet by eight.  The next step was to sink a shaft.
By this time the old-timers were regretting their
part in the affair.  They decided not to say
anything until after the cabin was finished, because
these strangers would have to build a cabin
somewhere in which to live.  Now they hesitated
to confess the trick they had played on their
new found friends.  They concluded that the
best way out for all concerned was to let them
learn necessary lessons in cabin building and
sinking a shaft, and then tell them, when they
had gone down a few feet and found no gold,
that probably they had better go and try again
on some outlying creek like Eureka or Black
Hills.  That looked the easiest way out of a
situation which had become unexpectedly
embarrassing.  The best they could do now was to
say nothing and give every assistance in hurrying
the farce to its finish.  After the cabin was
completed the snow was shovelled away from a
ten-foot patch where a landslide had made it
comparatively level.  There a fire was lit to
thaw the ground, for it never thaws in the
Klondike except by artificial means.  When this had
been burnt out they dug down three or four feet
to frost, cleared out the hole, and put down
another fire.  So by successive "fires" they
slowly worked their way down.  At ten feet they
had to stop digging operations to make a
hand-windlass, an "Armstrong hoist" we called it,
and a wooden bucket.  The fires for thawing
were still needed.  Now one man worked down
the shaft and the other on the windlass hoisting
the filled bucket and lowering the empty one.
They thawed and dug this way through four feet
of moss, then twelve feet of black "muck"
before they struck gravel.  They had been told not
to bother about "panning" in muck.  There was
never gold in muck anyway.  When they got
into gravel a pan of it was taken into the cabin
and washed out.  There were no results.
</p>

<p>
Keenly disappointed they went down to their
two friends that night and told them of their bad
luck in not getting gold when they got into
gravel.  They were interrupted by excited
exclamations and questions.  Surely it couldn't be
really gravel, they must be mistaken for no
gravel could get up there.  If it were true gravel
it meant the upsetting of all current placer
mining theories, and the prospect of unlimited
possibilities of new gold deposits on hillsides
and benches.  Such news would set the whole
Klondike on the stampede again.  But of course
there must be a mistake.  It was broken up
slide-rock and not gravel.  Next morning they would
come up and have a look.  So they did and there
was no doubt about the gravel.  The cheechacos
were advised to go on "sinking" and on no
account to "talk" at store or roadhouse.  After
every thaw the Australians went up to see how
things looked.  One day "colors" were found in
the pan, and after that the four worked together
unceasingly in rushing the digging as fast as the
need of thawing would permit.  The light flakes
of yellow gold continued but it wasn't "pay" yet.
</p>

<p>
One memorable evening, after an all-day spell
of work without panning, the four men gathered
in the little cabin around the panning tub in the
corner to test dirt taken out eight feet lower than
the last sample.  They were all bending over
eagerly, watching in the dim candle light one of
the sourdoughs, an expert, who was squatted
beside the tub with the pan in his hands under
water.  Holding it aslant, he twisted it back
and forth with a sort of circular motion until
the top dirt was gradually washed off and the
gravelly stones left.  These he scraped off with
his hands and then repeated the whole process.
Slowly the pan was emptying.  If there was any
gold it would be slipping down to the bottom
of the pan at the lower edge of it.  The candle
was held closer and breathlessly the four men
watched as the last few inches of the pan bottom
cleared of dirt.  There was only an inch of black
sand and gravel now.  The miner swirled the
pan in the water again, then brought it up and
near the candle, ran his finger through the
margin of dirt still remaining and as he did so he
left uncovered a shining track of yellow gold!
There was a moment's silence, a hurried, deft
swirl in the water and the pan was carried over
to the table.  There with bent heads they gazed
with tense emotion first at the slender thread of
gold and then at one another.  Not much in
itself, but it meant&mdash;well, who could tell what
amazing new finds it might mean?  Perhaps
richer than anything yet known!  Soon they were
talking in earnest excited tones.  The impossible
had come true and they had found, on that hill
side, a "prospect" which, if the pay dirt
continued for any distance or depth, would bring
untold wealth to them.  It was a great night in
that Klondike cabin.  The sourdoughs confessed
without reservation their attempt to play off a
joke and how they had long been ashamed of it.
The cheechacos laughed it off in good-will that
was heightened by the happy outcome of it all.
The Australians were to stake claims beside
them that night and then to rouse their friends
who were near and have them stake on half
interests.  The hillside was to be called on the
records "Cheechaco Hill" in memory of its
discoverers.
</p>

<p>
By the next day the news had leaked out, the
camp went crazy, and in a week every piece of
ground right over the Klondike summits from
creek to creek had been staked off in claims, no
matter how absurdly unlikely the locality was,
although in the scramble many very rich
hillsides were found.
</p>

<p>
Some punster said that the only "benches" in
the Klondike that weren't staked were those of
my log-church at Gold Bottom!  And it was
practically true.  I remember once when going
down Indian River noticing a tree with its trunk
"blazed," and on the blaze these words were
written: "I, Ole Nelson, claim 25 ft. straight up
in the air for climbing purposes!" He had been
chased up that tree by a bear and had put the
event on record in this way, and indeed about
the only direction by that time that was open
for staking was "up in the air."
</p>

<p>
There was, however, much reason for this
indiscriminate staking.  It seemed as if gold was
likely to be found anywhere now that it climbed
up the hillsides.  But in a year or two the mining
operations showed how the gold got there.  Ages
ago there had been an upheaval of some kind
that had changed the course of the streams and
had made valleys hills, and hills valleys.  These
deposits were in what had formerly been river
or creek bottoms.  The hill-side seemed an
unlikely place but the gold was there, and the
digging disclosed it buried deep where God had
placed it, not haphazard, but according to one
of the laws of nature.

<i>XI.</i>
<br /><br />
<i>The Lost Patrol</i>
</h3>

<p>
In the Spring of 1918, following the smashing
attack of the Germans towards Amiens,
orders came from the French Military Headquarters,
that all civilians were to move from
towns near the line to safer areas further back.
This order nearly got me into a "mix-up."  It
happened I was billeted at Madame Buay's
humble home in La Brebis, when the new
regulation came to them like a bomb from the blue.
</p>

<p>
One day soon after, at 5.30 A.M., Madame
and her boy came to my room to bid me a tearful
adieu.  It was arranged by the authorities that
they must leave before nine o'clock that morning.
There was much talk, and would I help her so
kindly by buying her poor little rabbits.  They
would starve if left behind and she could not
take them.  "There were just three," she said.
I bought them for twenty francs; thought they
would make a savoury stew for our Mess.
</p>

<p>
About half past nine, I went to view my
livestock.  When behold, to my dismay, I found
that my three rabbits had increased, in the course
of nature, to ten, and there were signs of more
"in the offing."  On the top of this came an
unexpected message for the Battalion to move out
at 2 P.M. that day.  I tried to sell my rabbits to
the local butcher, who had been permitted to
stay until he cleared out his stock of meat.  But
no, he wouldn't buy them.  They weren't, of
course, fit to kill for food.  At last in desperation,
for I couldn't leave the beasts to starve, I
rounded up the half-dozen small boys left in the
place and unloaded my rabbits on them.  I knew
the ordinary boy cannot resist the offer of a live
rabbit, even though father and mother might
object.  I would be gone by that time anyway.
I tell only the simple truth, (those who know
rabbits will not question it), when I state that I
had not three nor ten, but sixteen rabbits, big
and little, to give away to the boys.  A second
contingent had arrived numbering six!  I was
relieved to be quit of them, for at the rate they
had multiplied that day I could see myself,
before many weeks, marching at the head of a
battalion of rabbits!
</p>

<p>
It was pitiful to see these French people
leaving the homes in which they, or their ancestors,
had lived for generations.  Pathos and humor
combined, sometimes, in the appearance of the
odd conveyances and the motive-power used.  I
saw one dear old lady propped up in a
wheelbarrow, her son trundling her along.  There
were plenty other strange and sorry sights.
With it all they seemed cheerful, and
determined to make the best of everything.
</p>

<p>
This battalion-trek I stayed behind with a
half-company of men who had been held by
fatigue-duties.  When we set out we decided to
try a short-cut across the fields, but we wandered
considerably, and had not reached our destination
when supper-time drew near.  We had no
provisions with us.  While the men were resting
by the road, tired, hot, and hungry, I sauntered
off by myself to where I noticed a wreath of
smoke above the trees of an orchard.  I saw a
few soldiers there, standing by a fire not far
from the farm-sheds.  As I got closer two of
them came hesitatingly towards me, saluted, and
one said, "Sir, is your name Pringle?"  I said it
was, and then we discovered that eighteen years
before we had knocked around together in the
Atlin gold-diggings.
</p>

<p>
They remembered me after all those years!
They belonged to a detachment of Canadian
Railway Troops.  The upshot of it was that
when I told them of my tired and hungry kilties,
they got me into friendly touch with the
Q.M. Sergeant billeted in the farmhouse.  He showed
himself a right good fellow and in short order
I was on my way back to my men heading a small
but well-laden carrying-party.  Our boys could
hardly believe their eyes when they saw us
toddling along, laden with two big kitchen dixies
of hot tea, a dozen loaves of bread and a full
tin of good, fresh hard-tack.  The tea and rations
refreshed us and made the remaining kilometres
easy.
</p>

<p>
We found the battalion located in a picturesque
little farm-village.  The group of houses
lay snugly hidden among trees, while out on all
sides, over rolling land, one could see long
stretches of cultivated fields, in blocks of brown
and varying shades of green.  Other than the
farm buildings, there was only a small store, a
blacksmith shop, and a tavern.  The houses
were ancient, built with out-buildings to enclose
a court-yard, in the centre of which was, almost
invariably, a manure-pile and cess-pool.
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants were primitive in their ways,
kindly farm-folk of simple manners,
hard-working and apparently contented.
</p>

<p>
One well, over 130 feet deep, served for public
use.  It was worked by a hand-windlass and to
get a pail of water was a laborious process.  The
rough wooden shelter over it was erected, so the
inscription read, in 1879.  I suppose it was an
event in village history when that shelter was
added.  There must be a wide variety of things,
besides water, at the bottom of that well.  The
water tasted good enough, but one's imagination
should not be allowed to work too carefully over
the subject.
</p>

<p>
Chatting along the way after we left the
Railway Troops, my talk naturally turned from the
kindness done us through those Klondike
friends, to other fine men I knew in the North.
I was made to promise to tell "the bunch" a
Yukon Story some evening after we got properly
settled in our new billets.  Two or three nights
afterwards, I redeemed my promise.  In one of
the old barns, sitting on a low beam, with the
men lying around in the straw, I related to them
the grim tragedy of the Lost Patrol.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
In the annals of frontier-life anywhere you
like in the world, nothing can be found more
filled with heroic incident in the performance of
duty and the maintenance of a high prestige,
than the history of our own Canadian Mounted
Police.  I choose this particular story, because
it exemplifies, so clearly, their dominating sense
of duty and the quiet fortitude in the face of
danger and death, characteristic of their
splendid record.  It occurred in the far North, in
Klondike days, in a region through which I
have travelled and so it has for me a double
interest.
</p>

<p>
Every winter since the Big Stampede, the
Mounted Police have patrolled the four
hundred miles of wilderness lying between Dawson
and Fort McPherson.  The latter place consists
of a dozen log buildings, on the MacKenzie, far
in the Arctic.  It is the centre of administration
for a hundred thousand square miles of territory.
Dawson, the well-known gold-camp, is on the
Yukon River, close to the edge of the Arctic
Circle.  One round trip is made each winter,
with dog-teams carrying mail, personal and
official, needed to keep that Northern world of
Indians, Eskimo, Whites, and half-breeds, in
touch with civilization, and to uphold our
British traditions of law and order.
</p>

<p>
The journey is always beset with dangers.
One day out, and the members of the patrol
know that their lives depend wholly on
themselves.  They may see no one else for twenty or
thirty days.  They will go through a vast and
lonely land travelling along the wide valleys of
frozen rivers, up long narrow gulches filled with
snow, over miles of wind-swept mesas, and across
high, treeless, mountain ridges.  "All goes well,
if all goes well," is a proverb of the trail, for
in winter-time there, death is always near.  His
opportunity comes easily in numerous ways.  A
gashed foot cut by a slip of the axe in getting
firewood, a sprained ankle, an unsheltered camp
with a blizzard in the night, fog, or wind, or
snowstorm, sick dogs or men, short rations, a
mile in the wrong direction, all these very simply
lead to distress, maiming or death.  The greatest
and commonest danger comes from the glacial
overflows.  In winter the creeks freeze solid.
This dams back the water in its sources in the
banks, until the expulsive force in the hidden
springs, deep in the mountains, drives the water
out on top of the ice.  Even in the most extreme
cold you will find in these canyons, under the
snow or shoal ice, pools of this overflow water
remaining liquid for hours.  To get into this
with moccasins means an immediate camp and
fire, otherwise there will be frozen feet and
permanent crippling, and if one is alone and dry
wood not at hand, it is fatal.  All these and more
are the chances the experienced "musher" must
be prepared to take.  No "tenderfoot," in his
right senses, would attempt such a long journey,
in winter, alone.

It was the morning of December 21st, 1910,
that the patrol left Fort McPherson for Dawson.
It comprised Inspector Fitzgerald, Constables
Taylor and Kinney, and Special Constable
Carter, with three dog-teams of five dogs each.
They expected to be in Dawson about the
beginning of February.  They never reached
Dawson.  Their comrades at Fort McPherson
of course gave no anxious thought to them, and
when the Dawson search-party came in at close
of day on March 22nd, it was with surprise and
horror, that they heard of the loss of the whole
patrol.  Next day the frozen bodies of all four
were brought in, those who three months before
had set out on that wilderness journey, so keen
and strong.  They were found within thirty
miles of the Fort, but it was a long, long trail of
300 terrible miles that they had travelled.
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of January the Dawson
police commenced to expect the patrol.  After
the first week in February, they became uneasy.
On the 20th February some Fort McPherson
Indians arrived in Dawson.  One of them,
named Esau, had been with the patrol, as guide,
to the head of Mountain Creek, where he was
discharged on New Year's Day.  The Police had
lost their way, had come on this camp of Indians
and employed Esau to guide them until Fitzgerald
was satisfied the party could do without
him, when he was dismissed.  It was a tragic
mistake.
</p>

<p>
On the 28th February, Supt. Snyder of the
Dawson Post, fearing trouble, despatched the
relief-party under Corporal Dempster, consisting
in addition, of Constables Fyfe and Turner
and a half-breed named Charles Stewart.
March 12th, on the McPherson side of the
Divide, Dempster saw the first sure traces of the
lost patrol.  In the Big Wind River valley he
found a night-camp which had doubtless been
made by the missing men.  There were one or
two empty butter and canned-beef tins lying
about and a piece of flour-sack marked,
"R.N.W.M. Police, Fort McPherson."  The morning
of March 16th, they discovered a toboggan and
seven sets of dog-harness "cached" about six
miles up Mountain Creek.  On searching more
carefully, a dog's paws and shoulder-blade were
found, from the latter of which, the flesh had
evidently been cooked and eaten.
</p>

<p>
Ten miles from Seven-Mile Portage, March
21st, Dempster noticed a blue handkerchief tied
to a willow.  He went over to it, climbed the
bank, and broke through the fringe of willows
into the timber.  There before his eyes was the
end of a chapter in the sad story.  In the snow
lay the bodies of Constables Kinney and Taylor.
A fire had been at their feet.  Their camp kettle
was half-full of moose-skin, which had been cut
up into small pieces and boiled.  Dempster's
party cut some brush, covered the bodies with it,
and went on in the direction of the Fort.  He
says in his report, "I had now concluded that
Fitzgerald and Carter had left these two men
in a desperate effort to reach the Fort, and
would be found somewhere between this point
and McPherson.  Next morning, about ten
miles further down the river, a trail appeared
to lead towards the shore and while feeling
in the new snow for the old tracks underneath,
we kicked up a pair of snow-shoes.  We then
climbed the bank and a little way back in
the woods we came on the bodies of the other
two men.  This was Wednesday the 22nd
March.  Carter had died first, for he had been
laid out upon his back, his hands crossed upon
his breast and a handkerchief placed over his
face.  Fitzgerald lay near him."
</p>

<p>
Dempster and his party then went on to Fort
McPherson arriving about six o'clock in the
afternoon the same day.  There help was
obtained and the remains were brought in.  On
March 28th, the four bodies were laid side by
side, in the same grave.  The funeral service
was read by the Rev. C. E. Whittaker, the
Church of England missionary at that remote
point.  A firing-party of five men fired the usual
volleys over the grave.  The brave men of the
lost patrol had all come to their last camping-ground.
</p>

<p>
Fitzgerald's diary of the fatal journey was
found.  He had kept it up to Sunday, February
5th, when it ceased.  Between the lines, for there
is no sign of weakening in the written words, one
can read the pathetic story of a long struggle
against death from starvation and exposure, an
heroic battle, maintained to the last in terrible
agony.  Let me quote but six entries from the
diary.  It was carefully written commencing
December 21st, the day they left the Fort.  It
is a sad but thrilling drama extending over fifty
days, staged in a mystic, white, winter-land,
cruel and lonely, silent too, save for the howl of
wolf or roar of mountain storm.  Every entry
is of absorbing interest, but the quotations suffice
to tell of the fateful seven days spent in vainly
searching for the pass up Forrest Gulch, and
then the brave struggle to retrace their steps to
Fort McPherson.  Death ever came closer,
stalked at last beside them every moment.  He
had no power to destroy their unconquerable
spirits but he finally claimed their weary,
worn-out bodies.  Here is the chronicle.
</p>

<p>
"Tuesday, Jan. 17th.  Twenty three degrees
below zero.  Fine in the morning, with a strong
gale in the evening.  Did not break camp.  Sent
Carter and Kinney off at 7.15 A.M. to follow
a river going south by a little east.  They
returned at 3.30 P.M. and reported that it ran
right up into the mountains, and Carter said it
was not the right river.  I left at 8.00 A.M. and
followed a river running south but could
not see any cuttings on it.  Carter is completely
lost and does not know one river from another.
We have now only ten pounds of flour, and eight
pounds of bacon, and some dried fish.  My last
hope is gone (of getting through to Dawson) and
the only thing I can do is to return and kill some
of the dogs to feed the others and ourselves,
unless we can meet some Indians.  We have now
been a week looking for a river to take us over
the divide, but there are dozens of rivers and I
am at a loss.  I should not have taken Carter's
word that he knew the way from Little Wind
river."

"Tuesday, Jan. 24th.  Fifty-six below.  Strong
south wind with very heavy mist.  Left camp
at 7.30, went six miles and found the river
overflowed right across.  Constable Taylor got in to
the waist and Carter to the hips, and we had to go
into camp at 11.00 A.M.  Cold intense for all
the open water.  Killed another dog and all
hands made a good meal on dog-meat."

"Tuesday, Jan. 31st.  Forty-five below.  Sixty-two

A.M. had to double-up teams for the first mile
and a half.  Nooned one hour and camped at
4.15 P.M. four miles from Caribou river.  Going
heavy, travelled part of the time on our old
trail, but it was filled in.  Skin peeling off our
faces and parts of the body, lips all swollen and
split.  I suppose this is caused by feeding on
dog-meat.  Everybody feeling the cold very
much for want of proper food.  Made seventeen
miles."

"Wednesday, Feb. 1st.  Fifty-one below.  Left
camp at 7.30 A.M. and camped at 4.30 P.M. on
the river where we start around Caribou Born
mountain.  Killed another dog to-night.  This
makes eight dogs that we have killed.  We have
eaten most of them and fed what dried fish we
had to the dogs.  Sixteen miles."
</p>

<p>
"Friday, Feb. 3rd.  Twenty-six below.  Left
camp at 7.15 A.M.  Men and dogs very thin
and cannot travel far.  We have gone about 200
miles on dog-meat and have still about 100 miles
to go.  I think we shall make it all right but will
have only three or four dogs left.  Fourteen
miles."

<p>
"Saturday, Feb. 5th.  Forty-eight below.  Just
after noon I broke through shoal ice and had to
make fire, found one foot slightly frozen.  Killed
another dog to-night; have only five dogs now
and can only go a few miles a day: everybody
breaking out on the body and skin peeling off.
Eight miles."
</p>

<p>
These were his last written words, except his
will, scrawled on a torn piece of paper with a
cinder from the burnt-out fire by which he died.
It read;&mdash;"All money in despatch bag and bank,
clothes etc., I leave to my beloved mother,
Mrs. John Fitzgerald, Halifax.  God bless all."
</p>

<p>
So, in brief, runs the story of the "Lost
Patrol."  There have been widely-heralded
expeditions to North and South Poles.  In their
months of outfitting and general preparations,
these expeditions left nothing undone to ensure
safety that science could devise or money buy.
They knew they had the eyes of the world upon
them with the consequent urge to worthy
endeavour.  I wish to take no honour from them,
but to me there is something finer in the way
brave men in lonely places and at dangerous
tasks, in civilian as in military life, risk death
continually, not for glory, or fame, or riches,
but simply in doing their routine of duty year
after year.  The world takes little notice, save
when some startling tragedy occurs, and then
soon forgets.
</p>

<p>
This story is not told in vain if it will remind
Canadians of our own noble fellows, who in the
wilds of our far-flung northern boundaries are
adventuring their lives in these so-called
"common" ways.  "Their heroic efforts," says
Commissioner Perry, "to return to Fort McPherson,
have not been exceeded in the annals of Arctic
travel.  Corporal Dempster's reports show that
the unfortunate men were wasted to shadows.
All were strong, powerful, young men, and in
the best of health and condition, when they left
on their ill-fated journey.  It is the greatest
tragedy which has occurred in this Force during its
existence of thirty-seven years.  Their loss has
been felt most keenly by every member, but we
cannot but feel a thrill of pride at their firm
endeavour to carry out their duty, and the
subsequent prolonged struggle they made to save
their lives."

<p>
The evening of August 7th, 1918, saw the
British troops in France massed under
cover along a front of many miles, ready for the
morning and the grand attack of August 8th
which led to our final victory.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the vast organization of our
allied armies, now all under Gen. Foch, gigantic
preparations of microscopic thoroughness had
been going on for weeks.  Our intentions had
been most wonderfully hidden from our foes by
all the artifices of elaborately developed
camouflage.  At night the roads of France back of the
line were filled with hundreds of thousands of
infantrymen marching to their appointed places;
with countless batteries of big guns and little
guns, and munitions, moving as required by the
great secret plan; with lorries, armoured cars,
and tanks, pounding along in almost endless
succession through the darkness.  In the daytime
little movement was to be seen beyond what was
usual.  Artifices, many and varied, were used to
trick our foes, such as fake attacks in Flanders by
a platoon or two of Canadians left in the north
to mislead the enemy, the Canadian troops being
then far south.  Altogether it seemed that the
Germans were left wholly in the dark as to our
purposes.  It was the largest and most brilliantly
arranged venture in the war.  Armistice Day
testifies how well the plans were carried
through.
</p>

<p>
Our own corps had been slipping by night into
a little patch of timber, on the Roye road, called
Gentelles wood.  We had been gathered there
for two days, lying low but so packed in, that,
if the enemy artillery had dropped a single shell
anywhere in the woods, it would have decimated
a battalion.  What a chance they missed!
Enough to give old Hindenburg the nightmare
if he knows of it.  It seemed like another direct
intervention of Providence.  For weeks before,
the Germans had shelled these woods, a little,
almost every day, but now, at the very time when
a few shells would have materially disarranged
our plans, something stayed the hands of the
gunners and not a single shell or bomb came
near us.
</p>

<p>
On the 7th, as soon as it was dark enough, the
tanks, hidden in the brush at the edge of the
wood and by hedges at roadsides, commenced
to move to their attack positions.  Two score
must have passed through our battalion bivouac.
The leading tank made its own road crashing
through the brush, going over ditches and fallen
timber, and turning aside only for the large
standing trees.  Each driver, hidden away in the
tank and peering through the small look-out,
could see only the lighted end of his officer's
cigarette which was used to guide him in the
deep darkness of the trees.  No other lights were
allowed.  When they were gone we too moved
forward, deploying to our positions in trenches
ready for "zero-hour" next day.
</p>

<p>
The night passed safely, a momentous night,
in which the enemy had his last good chance to
spoil our plans and save himself from
overwhelming defeat.  Just before dawn, through
the light morning mist, our artillery barrage
came down with infernal noise and destructive
effect.  It told the enemy that we were going to
attack.  The German batteries of course replied
with damaging precision, but it was too late
then to save the day.  Our guns lengthened range
and the tanks went forward.  The other fighting
units followed and by sunrise the grand attack
had been fully launched up and down the whole
British and French front.  It was an attack that
was to continue victoriously for three months,
finally forcing the Germans on Nov. 11th
to confess themselves well and thoroughly
whipped.
</p>

<p>
In this splendid affair the Canadian Corps
had a place of special honor on the extreme
right of the British line, and facing the central
attack-area beyond Amiens down the Roye road.
Of our own battalions the 43rd was on the right
flank linking up with the left wing of the French
troops.  The "liaison platoon" was half
Canadian Camerons and half French "poilus."  This
junction sector would probably be the place of
greatest danger to the success of the whole
advance, for there, if anywhere, misunderstanding
or conflict in orders might occur leading to a
dangerous dislocation in the long line of the
Allies.  We were very proud of the confidence
placed in us.  The results show that it was not
misplaced.
</p>

<p>
It was a glorious victory.  The tanks cleared
up the out-lying German defence posts and
enabled our machine-gunners and infantry
following them, to put their full strength against
the main German positions.  Before noon the
Hun was on the run.  We chased him helter-skelter
through fields of yellow grain, across
meadows, and down dusty roads, cornered and
captured hundreds of his men in orchards and
chateaux.  It was sunny, summer weather in one
of the loveliest parts of France.  Our success
had surpassed expectations and we were still
going on.  There were "beaucoup souvenirs."  The
enemy in his hurry had left a litter of stuff
behind him, post-cards half-written, tobacco-pipes
half-smoked and still warm, shaving
brushes with fresh lather on them, breakfasts
commenced but finished elsewhere, if ever
finished.
</p>

<p>
On Aug. 11th, three days after the attack our
brigade was camped under the trees beside a
chateau which had been a German Divisional
Headquarters on Aug. 8th, and was now ten
miles behind our line.  I remember it distinctly
for that day, a Sunday, I had preached my
farewell sermon to my battalion.  I had been
inveigled into asking for a recall to England.
They said I needed a rest.  Perhaps I did, and
then at that time you couldn't tell how much
longer the war was to last.  If I had foreseen
an armistice in twelve weeks I should have done
differently.  So I was to go to Blighty for a few
months, my substitute had reported for duty and
there was nothing for me to do but go.
</p>

<p>
A group of men sat around me beneath the
trees, as I lingered that afternoon, chatting about
odds and ends of things, leaving the subject that,
I think, was uppermost in our minds pretty
much untouched, for we were all loth to say
good-bye.  Somehow the talk turned to stories
of clever camouflage suggested by some of our
recent experiences and the boys told several good
yarns.  I outlined an old one I had heard my
father tell of the arts of camouflage practised
by Indians in his own soldier days in Upper
Canada.  This elicited enquiries about my
father, and how he came to be soldiering in
Canada so long ago.  It was a story I knew well,
and so it was easily told.  These men were
friends of mine, true and tried, and I knew they
would understand and fill in from their hearts
the simple outline I gave them of my father's
life.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Ever since I can remember, Edinburgh has
been to me the fairest city in the world.  I am
Canadian-born, my mother also, but my father
was an Edinburgh man, and my earliest memories
are filled with word-pictures of that city
drawn in warm tones of affection by a home-sick
Scot.  Many an hour have I sat at my father's
feet, as we gathered around the fire of a winter's
evening, listening to his stories.  He had a wide
range of Indian and soldier anecdotes so dear to
a boy's heart, but none of them live so clearly
in my recollection as those he had to tell of his
birth-place.  Long before I knew what
geography was I had a fairly intimate knowledge of
Edinburgh.  Calton Hill, Arthur's Seat,
Samson's Ribs, Holyrood Palace, High Street and
Princes Street, I had the right location and a
true picture of them all.  When boy-like I
would be building forts with blocks or in the
sand, they would always be called Edinburgh
Castle.
</p>

<p>
I knew all his stories except one, and that one
was his own life.  I heard that too, at last, and
it came about in this wise.  An important
registered letter used to come to father quarterly,
containing his soldier's pension.  Until I was
well along in school I was not specially interested
in the envelope or its contents, but one day
I read the address as it lay near me on the table,
and it was "559 Cpl. G. McDonald, R.C.R."  Naturally
I became curious.  My father, George
Pringle, was getting George McDonald's letter
and money.  My father was honest, I never, of
course, questioned that.  Still it was a puzzle to
my boyish mind.  He came into the room, saw
what I was doing, and so I asked him to tell
me about it.  "It must look odd to you, my boy,"
he said, "and I've been waiting until you were
old enough to hear and understand the explanation.
To-night after supper, if no visitors come,
I'll tell you the reason of it."  That evening
under the lamplight we gathered around his
arm-chair and he told his own story.
</p>

<p>
"Long ago," he said, "when I was a boy, our
family were living very happily in what was
then one of the best parts of old Edinburgh.
My father was a man of substance and gave us
all a good schooling and a trade.  Of my mother
I shall only say that she was to me the most
wonderful and the most beautiful woman in the
world.  I had a twin brother John and we were
very much alike in appearance.  When we were
fourteen years old our mother died.  We
mourned as only boys of that age can mourn,
with deep grief too poignant for words.  Within
three years father married again.  Our
stepmother was an excellent woman and kind to us,
and I know now my father did right.  But we
couldn't bear to have anyone else in our own
mother's place.  Loyal in our love to her we
grew embittered towards our father.  There
were no "words," but when about seventeen
years old we ran away from home, tramped south
to London, and there, being Edinburgh tradesmen,
soon found work.  A year or so and then
we got an inkling that father had traced us.
Determined not to go back we enlisted in the
Rifle Brigade and to hide our identity gave our
names as John and George McDonald, our
mother's maiden name.  You see where our
hearts were.  Within the year our unit left for
Canada, and we had been in barracks at Halifax,
Nova Scotia, only a few months when we were
paraded one day before the commanding officer,
Col. Lawrence.  He took us into his own room
and there he spoke to us as a friend.  He had
received a letter eloquent with a father's love
for his two wandering laddies.  Father had
traced us by our Christian names, and our
likeness to each other.  I think, too, the name
McDonald, which we thought would baffle him,
only made him more certain.  Col. Lawrence
read the letter aloud to us, and it moved us
deeply.  Money enough was enclosed to buy our
discharge and pay our passage home.  The
officer urged us to return.  At first we were
inclined to yield, but some dour devil of bitterness
took control of our hearts and we said we would
not go, would accept no money, and wished to
have no further communication with our father.
Such was the unrelenting reply the colonel
would have to send back to Edinburgh.  How
many, many times has remorse punished me for
that unkind decision.  Yet we blindly thought
that love and loyalty to the mother we had lost
made it right that we should turn our backs on
our father's outstretched arms.  We never heard
from him again, and we have lost all trace of
our relatives in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
"You can easily construct the rest of my story.
After serving some years more we left the army
for a time.  I was married to your mother, Mary
Cowan, at Murray Harbor South, Prince Edward
Island.  Shortly after we re-enlisted under
our army name in the Royal Canadian Rifles,
then a newly organized regiment, with which I
served until I finally gave up the soldier life,
and settled in Galt under my right name.  My
service was sufficient to get me a medal and a
pension.  The pension comes addressed as you
have seen, and the medal is similarly inscribed.
It is the regimental number that identifies me
and the money and medal are rightfully mine.
But a thousand pensions can never ease my heart
of regrets for the suffering we needlessly
inflicted on our father who loved us and whom we
loved."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
This was the homely story told in my father's
words to those kiltie lads that summer afternoon
under the apple trees in an alien land.  They
listened and understood, for every true Scottish
heart responds to these stories of our own folk
and our homeland.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  From the lone shieling of the misty island<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountains divide them, and a waste of seas,<br />
  But still the blood is strong, the heart is Highland,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they in dreams behold the Hebrides.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And it's all the same whether they are from
the east coast or the west, the Highlands, or the
Islands, or the Borders, city or country-born,
the Scot never knows the place Scotland has in
his affections until he becomes an exile.
</p>

<p>
I slipped away after saying farewell, and,
with my faithful henchman Macpherson,
climbed up on a waiting lorry and was off down
the dusty road towards Boulogne, homesick for
the men I left behind me.

<p>
It was my privilege to spend the winter of
1919-20 in Edinburgh taking lectures at New
College, a glorious year.  I had searched the city
for traces of my father's people without success,
and had almost given up hopes of ever finding
them.  One day early in the session I was
standing in the Common Hall of the college
chatting with other students, when one of them
named Scott asked me if he might enquire why
my father went to Canada, for I had been saying
he came from Edinburgh.  I gave him a few
details and he seemed much interested.  Further
explanations and his eyes lighted up with
excitement.  I soon found what caused it.  Several
eager questions and answers back and forth and
I knew that one of my great ambitions had been
realized.  I had found one of the old Edinburgh
Pringles from whom we had been estranged so
many years.  His mother was a Pringle, the
daughter of an older brother of my father's.  It
was one of the supreme occasions of my life.  In
our hand-clasp in that college hall under the
shadow of the Castle, the separation of nearly
a century was ended.  Some of you can guess
how deeply I was stirred.  Fancy or fact, I was
certain he had my father's voice and eyes.  We
opened our hearts to each other and it was
pleasant talk.  I had reason to be proud of my
new-found cousin.  He was then assistant-minister
in one of the noblest of Edinburgh's
many fine churches, "Chalmer's Territorial
United Free," commonly called "The West
Port."  My first sermon in my father's city was
preached from his pulpit, and in it I could not
forbear telling the congregation of the strange
and happy meeting with their minister.

<p>
For three months in the fall of 1918 I served
with the 1st Canadian Tanks.  Canada had
two tank battalions organized late in the war.
Neither of them had the good fortune to get to
France.  The first was composed of volunteer
recruits drawn largely from the Universities of
Ontario and Quebec, and they were a remarkably
keen lot of soldiers.  Quite a number of the
officers belonged to the faculties of these colleges
and many of the men were graduates or undergraduates.
</p>

<p>
After arrival from Canada they were under
canvas for a week or two at Rhyll in Wales, but
soon moved into permanent quarters on the
Bovington farm in Dorset county.  Bovington
was a great tank camp.  A number of Imperial
tank units along with ours were located there for
training, with large machine-shops and many
auxiliary units.  The country immediately
around the huts swarmed with soldiers and
"herds" of noisy tanks.
</p>

<p>
I joined the battalion for duty about
mid-August and stayed with them until after the
Armistice.  Those were very happy weeks.
Everyone was good to me.  Besides I had just
come from the turmoil of France, and the
quaint, quiet, pastoral beauty of Dorset seemed
a haven of peace.  I had pleasant times in camp.
Then there were exhilarating walks to take with
my good friends, Somerville, Smith, Macfarlane,
Bobbie Kerr and others, over the downs
through miles of purple heather, and along deep
hedge-lined country roads to some old-fashioned
thatch-roofed village, where we would have tea
and a rest before returning.  Or of a morning we
would walk down the six miles to Lulworth
Cove on the coast, three miles of our journey
between hedges of giant rhododendron, with the
limbs of oak, pine and beech trees forming a
leafy arch over our heads.  At the Cove hotel
we would enjoy one of their famous boiled-lobster
dinners, with potatoes, water-cress and
lettuce, and a rice-custard dessert.  Dorset, too,
is a country filled with stirring, historic association
recalling frequent battles fought against
sea-borne invaders, and many also were the
smugglers' stories we heard of this shore so near to
France and so filled with coves and caves.
There is romance as well as adventure.  Thomas
Hardy found inspiration in the Dorset folklore
for his masterpiece, "Tess of the
D'Urbervilles."  The most imposing castle-ruin I have
seen is there, Corfe Castle, visible for miles
against the sky.  It recalls fierce attack and
prolonged siege in the days of Cavalier and Roundhead.
</p>

<p>
By the beginning of November the battalion
was through its training, taking in its written
examinations the highest marks in the camp.
Soon after came the eagerly-awaited order to
mobilize for France.  In a few days we had our
lorries parked, our kits ready, our fighting
"colors" up on our tunics, and our final letters
from England sent off home.  The day was set,
I think Nov. 14th, for our embarkation at a
channel port for France.
</p>

<p>
They would have done great deeds in battle
these fine bright lads, but they were not to be
given the opportunity.  Nov. 11th, 1918, was a
dismal day for the Canadian Tank Corps.  At
eleven o'clock the order, "Cease fire," sounded
along our whole line in France and the Armistice
emerged into history, blasting their hopes
of active service.  On a Sunday following I had
to preach a sermon of rejoicing to the battalion.
It was a parade service so that I had a
congregation of 900 men who gave me a perfect
hearing, but all the same the sermon was a
failure.  I knew it would be even if I had been
eloquent, and in my heart I was glad that these
Canadian boys could not rejoice with me.  They
were disgusted with their fate.  Another day or
two and they would have got to France, and that
would have been something, even if they hadn't
been fortunate enough to get into battle.
</p>

<p>
From their standpoint it was no occasion for
hilarity.  They fired no guns, they beat no
drums, and generally were a very gloomy-looking
lot of fellows.  I am enough of a barbarian
to like them all the better for it.  Later in the
week I tried to relieve the situation a little for
some of them by telling in the rest-hut one
evening what I knew of the naming of one of the
famous Klondike creeks.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
There is a well-known creek in the North
called Last Chance and I shall try to tell you
something of its story.  It may help you to feel
that while you missed the real fighting in France
there's still lots of chance of adventure in life
for you all.  Last Chance is a tributary of
Hunker Creek, fifteen miles in the hills back
of Dawson.  In the rush days a road-house was
put up there and named after the creek.  Later
it was assumed that the creek had got its name
from the road-house, and this had been so named
because it was the "last chance to get a drink"
outward bound on that trail.  But here's the real
story.
</p>

<p>
"Old Yank" was the man who gave the creek
its name.  He was a gambler of that kind who
go out into the wilds among giant mountain-peaks,
and in far-off, unnamed valleys alone
with their pick-axe, shovel, and gold-pan stake
their lives on the chance that there is gold in rock
or gravel.  Who can quarrel with such gambling?
There are no marked cards in that game.
If they win they win clean, and if they lose, well
they've lived a glorious, free life filled with
health, hope, and work without a master, and the
companionship of a few choice friends.
</p>

<p>
The old man had come to the time when he
knew that shortly his prospecting days would be
ended.  Then he would land in some Old Man's
Home unless he could make a clean-up soon and
have enough to save him from that baleful finish.
He had made several "stakes" when he was
younger in the southern mountains, but he had
either thrown his wealth away in the purchase
or development of worthless claims, on further
prospecting expeditions, or had lost it in a gold
camp where he had been fleeced by some of the
various kinds of human vultures which always
flocked to the gold-diggings, when they proved
rich, to prey upon the miners.
</p>

<p>
He told me a story of how once in the early
days in the Caribou he was sitting in a card
game with a number of strangers.  He had lost
half his spring clean-up to them when the police
raided the road-house and took them all "in"
to stand trial before Judge Begbie.  Begbie was
a man noted for his swift, stern methods and his
keen penetration in court.  He didn't interfere
with what he called "square" card gambling
among a group of miners, but he was a terror to
the professional card-sharper.  Next day every
man pleaded that he was a working miner and
had just come in from the hills.  Where all were
dressed alike in rough clothes it seemed
impossible to decide who were telling the truth.
Begbie never hesitated.  "Show me the palms
of your hands," he said, and the constable made
them line up with their hands held up, palms
out.  The judge inspected them rapidly, ordered
two men detained and dismissed the others.
Those released had callouses on their hands that
you can get only by the use of pick and shovel.
The two detained, questioned, and sent to
penitentiary in New Westminster were soft-handed.
</p>

<p>
When I first met Yank the sinews of his right
hand were so drawn up and stiffened by the jar
of the pick through years of work that he could
not open his hand.  The way he got his fingers
around the pick-handle was by shoving the end
of it in with his left hand through the curve of
thumb and forefinger on his right.
</p>

<p>
He was busy prospecting in a valley near the
Klondike at the time those wonderful gold-fields
were discovered.  He was only a divide or two
away.  A squaw-man passing with three Indians
on his way to the mouth of the Klondike to fish
salmon had stopped a day with him.  He advised
the man to "pan" here and there, where there
was rim-rock showing, as they went along in the
creek-bottoms.  He himself was getting light
prospects and it might be better closer in to the
Klondike basin.  He asked and was promised
that, if they struck anything good, one of them
would come back and let him know.  They followed
his advice and found rich pay on Rabbit
Creek, but they failed to keep their promise to
the old man whose advice had so enriched them.
Yank never knew of the Klondike stampede,
until the next year when two strangers, who had
got lost, wandered into his valley and told him
the amazing news.  He put on his pack and left
forthwith but he was too late.  Hundreds of men
from Stewart and Forty-Mile were now located
on the best ground and the stream of stampeding
"cheechacos" from the outside world was
already commencing to flood in.  There was
nothing left that he thought worth staking.  He
crossed the ridge from Rabbit Creek, (now
called Bonanza), with a heavy heart, heading
back to his lonely cabin.  Off the divide he came
into a narrow gulch which he followed.  It
widened into a good-sized valley.  He was
surprised as he went along to see neither cabins
nor claim-stakes.  He travelled its whole length
indeed and found none.  Although right in the
rich region it had been overlooked.  When he
got to the mouth of the gulch he saw why, in
those first days of hurried staking it had been
left untouched, for the valley narrowed into a
very small opening where it entered the larger
Hunker creek.  The stampeders passing up and
down Hunker would rarely see the scarcely
noticeable break in the hills hidden by the trees,
or if they saw it would not think it worth
exploring.  He lost no time in going back up the
creek to the wider part.  There he put down a
hole near the rim where it was only a few feet
to bed-rock and found excellent prospects.  He
now set about staking Discovery claim.  With
his axe he cut, about five feet from the ground,
a smooth four-inch face on four sides of a small
tree in the centre of the valley, and then
pencilled on the down-stream side this inscription,
"No. 1 Post.  Discovery claim.  I, Joe. Chronister,
claim fifteen hundred feet down-stream,
and from base to base, for placer mining
purposes," signed his name with date and hour, and
the number of his miner's certificate.  Then he
stepped off five hundred paces roughly downstream
through the brush and then "blazed" his
second tree as before, marking it, "No. 2 Post,
Discovery claim," and writing as on No. 1, with
"down-stream" changed to "up-stream."
</p>

<p>
He camped that night on his claim, and before
he lay down on his spruce-bough bed to sleep,
he sat awhile by the dying fire dreaming old
dreams again.  Perhaps this time it would be
very rich; it prospected fine but "prospects"
were only prospects.  "Well," he mused,
"old-timer, you're near the end of the game.  If
there's nothing good under the muck here it will
be 'over the hill to the poorhouse' for you.  It's
your last chance, last chance."
</p>

<p>
It was with this thought running through his
mind that next day he entered the recording
office in Dawson, with his good friend the
stalwart Capt. Jim McLeod at his side to see that
he got square treatment, and recorded discovery
on his creek which was named on the government
records, "Last Chance," at his request.
</p>

<p>
It is good to know that Yank's claim was rich.
Providence had been kind to the old man.  He
saved his clean-ups and lived in comfort the
rest of his days in a snug log-cabin in Dawson,
near the wild waters of the turbulent Klondike,
where they rush into the depths of the mighty
Yukon.

<br /><br />
<i>A Moose Hunt</i>
</h3>

<p>
It was my good fortune to be in London on
"leave" the day the Armistice was signed.
At 11 o'clock in the morning the multitude of
giant "siren" whistles, used for warning the
approach of enemy air-craft, broke into a wild
chorus of deafening howls, and Londoners knew
that Germany, the aggressor, had accepted the
lowly seat of the vanquished.  The sounds of
public rejoicing commenced immediately and by
the late afternoon the celebration was in full
swing.  It was a celebration in which I could
not be content with a spectator's part.  I entered
into it with all my heart.  The whole outburst,
for the first day at least, was the spontaneous and
natural expression of joy at a glad release from
the curse of war, which had lain heavily upon
the Old Land for four long, black, bitter years.
</p>

<p>
I then started out early in the evening,
mingling with the immense crowds down Southampton
Row and Kingsway to the Strand, along to
Trafalgar Square, then up to Piccadilly, and
home after midnight by way of Regent and Oxford
Streets.  All those great thoroughfares and
squares were filled from side to side with
whirlpools of people.  Everywhere were groups of
dancers or singers, all sorts of foolish processions
big and little, all sorts of bands, noisemakers and
fireworks.  Workmen standing on ladders,
surrounded by thousands of madly cheering
observers, were taking the light-shields off the
street-lamps.  This meant that London streets
would be lighted for the first time since 1914.
In the immense moving crowds huge circles
would form as if by magic, then everyone in it,
all strangers to one another, would join hands
and dance up and down, and in and out, to some
old song.  I got into one of these happy groups
by chance in front of Nelson's monument in
Trafalgar Square, where we all danced up to the
centre and back singing, "Here we go gathering
nuts in May," and then commenced to circle
round to the chorus of "Ring-a-ring-a-rosy."  We
were just like a throng of happy children at
a picnic.  Then the formation dissolved, and its
members disappeared into the singing, shouting,
noisy crowds.
</p>

<p>
I fell in with an English officer, and he and I
joined forces with an English bugler wearing
an Australian soldier's hat.  He had lost his own
cap and had picked this one up somewhere.
We three marched along arm-in-arm; the bugler
would blow a call, then pass the bugle to us and
we would each make some hideous noises upon it.
I had my Cameron glengarry on and as we crushed
along with the crowd, every now and then, out
of the clamor, I could hear voices calling to me,
"Well done, Jock," "Good old Scotty."  Don't
think we were at all conspicuous, for nearly
everyone was doing things quite as foolish.  We
felt compelled to shout, cheer, sing, or do
something to express our overflowing joy that the war
was past at long last.  These people of the Old
Country knew the deep tragedy, the terrible
heart-breaking, nerve-racking strain of the war
as Canada could not know it.  "It was meet that
they should make merry and be glad."  I saw
practically no drinking nor roughness.  It was
a remarkable demonstration free, that night,
from all the artificiality of pre-arrangement.
</p>

<p>
Next day I attended the Thanksgiving Service
at St. Paul's Cathedral.  The King and
Queen were there and many personages of note,
but it was common folk who filled the vast
building and crowded the streets for blocks around.
There was no sermon.  There could not have
been any sermon or preacher adequate to such
an occasion.  The fortieth chapter of Isaiah
was read, and how mystically and beautifully it
expressed our thoughts, short prayers were said,
and then the people stood up to sing, led by a
great military massed band and the Cathedral
organ.  The instrumental music alone was
enough to thrill one's soul, but when those
thousands joined, with heart and voice, in
melodious thanksgiving to God for release
from the abundant travail of the bitter years,
filling the glorious old temple full with a glad
tumultuous harmony, the effect was indescribable.
Hundreds were so moved they could find no
voice for song, and could only lift their faces
to heaven with tears of joy running down their
cheeks.  In all the history of the Empire there
never was a moment when the whole British
people were so stirred and held by such high and
tense emotion.  The glad, loud song of thankfulness
had also the minor note vibrant with sorrow,
there was the echo of a sob in it.  This great
nation, rejoicing in righteous victory, kept sad and
sacred memories of her million slain.
</p>

<p>
While in London for these few wonderful
days I stayed at the West Central Hotel, and
there, one afternoon later in the week, I was
delighted to meet an old "tillicum" of the trails,
Tom Patton.  For three rare days we companied
together and talked about old friends and other
days.  We revelled in memories of the glorious
years we spent together in the far-off northland.
In imagination we travelled again many a
well-known mile, and memorable experiences we had
in common were recalled.  I was sorry when the
last day of my leave came, for Patton was one of
the very best of my old Yukon friends and "there
are no friends like the old friends after all."  That
last evening three other old Klondikers,
whom we had discovered in London, foregathered
with us in my room and enjoyed a
Yukon evening.  There were many interesting
stories told that night.  Each had his own
contribution, and there were some yarns in whose
spinning we all lent a hand.  There was one
in which Patton and I had equal share, one I
had often told to my comrades in France to while
away a weary hour.  It described a hunting trip
up the Yukon river he and I took one fall to
get some wild-fowl.  We ran on bigger game
and that is why I call it a Moose Hunt.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
In 1906, late in the autumn, when every night
brought sharp frost, and fish and fowl were
heading for the sea and the south to escape the
icy-fingers of on-coming winter, Patton and I
planned a fortnight's holiday up the Yukon to
shoot ducks.
</p>

<p>
We hired a rowboat at Dawson, and put it
aboard a river steamboat on which we had taken
passage up-stream about a hundred miles to the
mouth of White River.  There the steamer
slowed up enough to let us launch our boat and
get into it with our outfit, leaving us then on the
great river to our own devices.
</p>

<p>
We decided to make camp immediately for it
was getting on in the day.  So we pulled across
to the left bank, tied up our boat, and
commenced to look about us.  I noticed a
well-marked trail in the brush which I followed for
a few yards and came on a cabin.  I knocked at
the door and it was quickly opened by the
occupant.  I told him who I was and he asked me
in.  The place was dark, dirty, and smelly, nor
was I taken with the man's personal appearance,
for his hair was long and tangled, and his face
almost hidden by an untrimmed beard.  His
welcome was genuine, however, and when I
grew accustomed to the dim candle-light I
noticed that he had clear, kindly eyes.  He was
glad to see me.  I was his first visitor in three
months.  He had staked some gold-bearing rock,
and there he had lived alone for a year trying to
uncover it enough to prove it a real ledge, and
to prospect it sufficiently so that he might
interest "capital" in it.  He had absolute faith in
the value of his find, talking with assurance of
the day when he would sell it for thousands.
</p>

<p>
I informed him that I had a partner and called
to Patton who came along.  We told him what
we were out for.  He advised us to stay the night
there, and in the early morning we would be
sure to get some sport in the marshes, ponds, and
slack-water where the White joins the Yukon.
He wouldn't hear of us making camp for ourselves,
and we had to accept his hospitality.  He
was very lonely, he said, and it did him a whole
lot of good to see us and have some talk.
</p>

<p>
Late in the afternoon we went out to examine
the ground and arrange our morning shoot.  We
heard a strange noise coming from beyond the
distant northern skyline of the river valley.  It
sounded like the far-off cackling of barn-yard
geese.  Soon the source of it appeared in the
north.  It was the advance guard of a great flight
of sandhill cranes on their journey to the south
coast.  They are toothsome birds, about the size
of a small turkey but standing higher.  They are
very shy and it is all but impossible to get them
within range of a shot-gun.  I am not exaggerating
when I say that they flew for two hours in a
continuous, clamorous stream of arrow-shaped
formations from our northern horizon, until
they disappeared from view over the southern
hills.  There were thousands of them in that one
contingent.
</p>

<p>
The old-timer, "Alabama Bill" he was called,
served for supper that night a meat-stew
composed of porcupine, moose-meat and other
things.  I ate my share and kept it.  Patton is
more sensitive that way than I am, and on this
occasion he proved traitor to the good old
British maxim, "What we have, we hold."  I don't
blame him.  One had need of keen appetite and
strong digestion to enjoy and profit by that
mysterious mixture.  "Alabama" made us talk far
on into the morning, but at last we rolled into
our bunks.  We slept uneasily for various causes,
and were glad to get out in the early morning
to be ready in position for daylight and our
birds.
</p>

<p>
To make a long story short, we had good luck
the next ten days as we floated downstream
towards Dawson, tying up and camping when and
where we wished, and hunting in likely places.
The sloughs and little lakes were alive with
ducks and geese, and we had our boat half-full
of them before we reached Indian river.  From
that point it was an easy day's run to Dawson.
</p>

<p>
We made camp on the shore at Indian in the
afternoon, and went back into the thick woods
on the extensive flats behind us to explore.  We
came on a pond and got a few more ducks.  This
pond was peculiar in that at one side a trail led
down to it, and the shore was trampled as if
herds of cattle were accustomed to water there.
It was a "moose-lick," a place to which for years,
at certain seasons, the moose came at night from
miles around, because the water and soil had in
them some salty substance which they liked or
needed.
</p>

<p>
We weren't hunting big game and so had
brought only one rifle for emergencies, but here
was a chance right under our noses that we
couldn't pass, although we knew it was rather
late in the season for moose to visit the lick.  At
the edge of the pond we picked a good-sized
tree that we could climb and find secure footing
in.  Then we went back the half-mile to the
shore and had supper.
</p>

<p>
When it grew dark we went out to our tree
and climbed up in it, to watch for the possible
coming of the moose.  For four long, miserably
cold hours we clung to our perch.  It was pitch
dark and absolutely silent, save for the dull
murmur of the Yukon, and the "plunk, plunk"
of some little diving duck at long intervals in
the pond.  Half-a-dozen times we were inclined
to abandon our vigil, but one encouraged the
other and we hung on.  About midnight we were
rewarded by hearing, through the darkness, a
sound like the breaking of a branch away on
the mountain slope.  It startled us, coming on
us out of the night when we were tense with
prolonged listening to unbroken silence.  Soon
there was no mistaking the approach of the
monarch of the woods.  It seemed as if some great
boulder were crashing down the hillside through
the trees.  Every now and then there would be
a minute of complete stillness, and we could
imagine him standing, with lordly, lifted head
and wide-branching antlers, listening and
sniffing the air for strange noises or smells.  He
seemed satisfied that no danger lurked in the
woods, for he came straight across from the foot
of the mountain.  At last by the noise we knew
he was nearing our tree.  Nearer he came and
very near, leisurely now, probably feeding.  In
the dense darkness we could see nothing of him
as yet until we heard something scrape against
our tree.  Looking down with straining eyes, I
marked his dark, slowly-moving outline in the
brush.  I could have dropped on the animal's
back had I been so minded.  The proverbial
"salt" might easily have been placed on his tail.
The time for action had come.  I had the rifle.
In the darkness I couldn't see the barrel, so real
aiming was impossible, but the moose was that
near I felt I couldn't miss him anyway.  I fired
where I judged his shoulder should be.  I regret
to tell you that the flame of the gun showed that
the bullet had gone an inch over his back, and
I had missed him altogether!  My left arm was
around a limb and so the second shot was a
trifle slow, but after the first, it seemed as if the
moose jumped into the air, turned, and was fifty
feet away in the timber on his back-trail when
he lit!  We heard him going at head-long speed
and fired at the noise, but he went on until the
sound died away in the distance.
</p>

<p>
We crawled down to the ground, stiff with
cold, and dumb with disappointment.  I knew
it was a complete miss, but "hope springs eternal
in the human breast," and we lighted matches
and searched the ground and leaves for bloodstains.
We searched his trail thus for twenty
yards, then gave up, went back to camp and
under our blankets.  Patton was very decent
about it.  He knew how I felt.  Once only did
he make reference to my failure.  The next day
we were nearing Dawson, where our friends
would come and inspect our "bag," when he
said, "Well, George, wouldn't it be pleasant to
pull into Dawson with a fine moose lying
between us in the boat?"  "Don't say another word,
Tom," I replied, "or I'll burst into tears!"
</p>

<p>
I felt my almost inexcusable failure very
keenly, for I made three separate trips, alone,
to Indian river, and hunted there persistently,
and very uncomfortably too, for that moose, but
he never gave me another chance.

<i>An Old Prospector</i>
</h3>

<p>
The good ship <i>Araguaya</i> of the Royal Mail
Steam Packet Line was under commission
during the war as a Canadian hospital ship on
the North Atlantic.  She and her sister ship the
<i>Essequibo</i>, with the <i>Llandovery Castle</i> and
<i>Letitia</i>, composed the fleet used to convey our
wounded from the old land to Canada.  The
<i>Letitia</i> was wrecked in a fog on the rocks near
Halifax with no loss of lives.  The <i>Llandovery
Castle</i> was sunk by a submarine while returning
empty to England.  Mostly all the ship's
officers, M.O.'s, nurses, and crew were drowned or
shot by the fiend who commanded the U-boat.
The chaplain, Capt. McPhail, was killed.  By
strange chance his body, with life-belt, was
carried towards France and months afterwards was
found on the beach and buried.
</p>

<p>
Thank God all the German submarines were
not run by such as sank the <i>Llandovery</i>.  I have
a snapshot taken from the deck of the <i>Essequibo</i>
of a U-boat which stopped that ship, searched
her thoroughly but courteously and then let her
go unharmed.
</p>

<p>
I spent ten months as chaplain on the
<i>Araguaya</i> and a happy time it was.  That was the
"cushiest" job I have ever had.  We were under
cover all the time, had abundance of good food
and luxuries for everyone, and every device that
money could buy to entertain our patients on
their nine-day trip across.  Besides, in my special
work I had a flock which never strayed far from
me.  They couldn't!
</p>

<p>
Practically all the staterooms had been taken
out, only sufficient being left for M.O's, nurses,
and ship's officers.  This made fine, large, airy
wards for the bed cases, fitted with swinging
cots so that they did not feel the roll of the vessel.
I had a comfortable room all to myself, for
Col. Whidden and later Col. Murray were both
very considerate of my comfort.
</p>

<p>
You will be interested to know that at the
celebration of the completion of the Kiel Canal,
the <i>Araguaya</i> was loaned by the R.M.S.P. Co. to
the Kaiser for use as his private yacht during
the regatta, as a token of British goodwill.  The
suite of rooms our O.C. used had been the
Kaiser's, and mine was one of those that "Little
Willie" had occupied!
</p>

<p>
The ship's officers and crew were all first-class
seamen of heroic stuff.  The majority of
them had been through the dread experience of
being torpedoed, some two or three times, and
had seen many of their mates shot down or
drowned.  Yet here they were from stoke-hold to
pilot-house carrying on as cheerfully as ever.
</p>

<p>
Capt. Barrett, the skipper, a short, stout,
ruddy-faced Englishman sat at the head of the
table, with our O.C. and officers to his right
and his own officers to his left.  Many a merry
meal we had together there.  I can hear Major
Shillington's steadying voice when he thought he
saw trouble ahead in our arguments, Gunn with
the happy laugh, Langham bringing us down to
cold, hard facts, and the others good men all,
with whom I companied those days.  Tell your
choicest funny story and you'd hear Capt.
Johnson's stage-whisper, "I kicked the slats out
of my cradle the first time I heard that!"  I
often wore my tartan uniform for "old-time's"
sake, and the Cameron trousers always started
the skipper bemoaning that now we'd have
a stormy night since the padre had put on
his "tempestuous pants."  Of course we
frequently fought the question out around the
table.  I based my claim to wear Highland garb,
blow high or blow low, not only on my connection
with the 43rd, but because I was a thorough-bred
Scot.  I carried the war into the enemy's
country by maintaining that it was wrong to let
anyone wear it but those of Scottish extraction.
My own Camerons were nearly all Scots, this I
know from careful official census taken in
France.  We had ten or fifteen per cent. who
did not belong to "the elect," but they became
fine fellows from being continually in such good
company, and I find no fault with them for
wearing the kilts.  But the principle is wrong.
Suppose on the field of battle a fierce and
haughty Prussian surrendered to a kilted man
whom he thought to be a Scot, only to find on
getting back to the corral that his captor was a
peaceful Doukhobor in kilts.  What a humiliation
and what cruelty!  I actually met an officer
in France belonging to a Canadian Kiltie
battalion (not ours) who asked me the meaning
of the words "Dinna Forget," the title of a book
which lay before him on the table.  I asked him
what he thought it was.  He said "I suppose
the name of a girl, the heroine of the story,
'Dinna' maybe a local way of spelling 'Dinah,'
and 'Forget' is her surname.  That's my guess."  He
was in full, Scottish, regimental field-uniform
when he spoke these words!  I was dumb
for a little before I could tell him what the
words really meant.  It is not the claim of
superiority of race but simply a matter of honest
practice.  The tartan costume has become the
recognized badge of Scottish birth or ancestry.
It is therefore perpetrating a fraud upon the
public for a man of any other race to parade in
this distinctively national garb.
</p>

<p>
It would fill too many pages even to outline
the varied aspects of our life aboard the boat.
Matron Shaw and her noble band of nurses
should have a page to themselves.  We carried
about nine hundred patients each trip and after
two days out, when they became able to hear
"The Return of the Swallow" recited without
getting pale around the gills, everything went
along with a hum.  There were lectures, concerts,
movies, shovelboard and deck tennis tournaments,
dozens of phonographs and all sorts of
parlor games and books, and on Sunday our
religious services.  The boys were all glad to be
going home to Canada and they were easily entertained.
</p>

<p>
The great event was, of course, our first sight
of land and then the disembarkation.  The later
trips we unloaded at Portland, Maine, and I
cannot recollect having seen a more magnificent
demonstration of public good-will than was
given us by those Yankees.  The first time we
put in there, while the boat was still twenty feet
away from the dock the thousands of people on
the wharf commenced to cheer and the bands to
play, and we were bombarded with candies,
cigars, cigarettes and fruit.  Much of it fell into
the water.  When we tied up a score of committees
came aboard and almost submerged us
under endless quantities of oranges, apples,
bananas, grapes, dough-nuts, cake, sandwiches,
ice-cream, tea, coffee and soft drinks, and
expensive candies and everything else that we
could eat or drink, that the law would allow, in
superabundance.  They took our hundreds of
letters and many telegrams and sent them without
costing us a penny.  The latest newspapers,
bouquets, of choice flowers for everyone, concert
parties, and indeed everything good that kind
hearts could think of was showered upon us.  I
remember a western bed-patient asked me if I
thought they would get him a plug of a special
brand of chewing tobacco.  He hadn't been able
to buy it in four years overseas and it was his
favorite.  "Sure thing," one of them said and in
half-an-hour two men came aboard lugging
along enough of that tobacco to stock a small
store!  I cannot go further into details.  Enough
to say that every trip it was the same, except that
their hospitality became more systematized.
Probably fifteen thousand wounded Canadian
soldiers passed through Portland on their way
home, and I know they will find it hard to
forget the free-handed, warm-hearted welcome they
got in that city.  This memory will surely be a
leaven working towards the maintenance and
development of peace and good-will between
Canada and the United States.
</p>

<p>
But I must tell my story of the North.  One
trip Major Dick Shillington persuaded me to
give them a Klondike evening.  We gathered
down below in "H" Mess and there I told
something of the life-story of my old friend of
by-gone days, a trail-blazer and prospector, Duncan
McLeod.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
When first I met Duncan McLeod, "Cassiar
Mac" he was commonly called, he and his partner,
John Donaldson, both old men, were working
far up a tributary of Gold Bottom Creek
which had not yet been fully prospected.  Each
liked to have his own house and do his own
cooking, and so they lived within a few yards
of each other in the creek bottom at the foot of
the mountain summit that rose between them
and Indian River.  My trail over to the other
creeks passed across their ground, and when
we became friends I seldom failed to arrange
my fortnightly trip over the divide so as to reach
their place about dusk.  I would have supper
with one or the other and stay the night.
</p>

<p>
McLeod was an old-country Scot, Donaldson
born of Scottish parents in Glengarry county,
Ontario.  I am not using their real names, but
they were real men.  One of them, Donaldson,
is still living in the wilds of the Yukon, still
prospecting.  He was the first white man the
Teslin Indians had seen and known.  They
looked upon him as their "Hi-yu-tyee," a sort of
super-chief, during the years he lived near them.
He had been just and kind with them, and his
consequent influence saved occasional serious
friction between the Indians and whites from
becoming murder or massacre.
</p>

<p>
After supper we would all three gather in
one of the cabins and I would hear good talk
until far towards midnight.  Then there would
be a pause and McLeod would say, "Well,
Mr. Pringle, I think it is time we were getting ready
for our beds."  I knew what he meant.  "Yes,
it is," I would reply.  The Bible would be
handed me, I would read a chapter and we would
kneel in prayer to God.  Then to our bunks for
a good sleep and early away in the morning
for me to make the twenty-five miles over the
heights to Gold Run before dark.
</p>

<p>
What great talks those were I used to hear.
I was only a boy then, and these old men had
seen so much of the wild free life of the West
of long ago days.  What stirring adventures
they had had!  They came west before the
railways by way of the American prairies, and,
lured by gold discoveries, had entered the
mountains, and then following the prospector's
will-o-the-wisp, the better luck that lies "just over
the divide," they had gone farther and farther
north.  They had met and become partners in
the Caribou camp, and had been together nearly
forty years, in the Cassiar, on the Stewart, at
Forty-Mile and now the Klondike.
</p>

<p>
Donaldson had a wonderful native power of
description.  When story-telling he would pace
slowly back and forth in the shadow beyond
the dim candle-light and picture with quiet,
resonant voice scenes and events of the past.
How vivid it seemed to me!  How the soul of
the young man thrilled as he listened!  Often
there was a yearning at my heart when under
his spell to lay aside my mission and go out into
the farthest wilds, seeking adventure and living
the free, fascinating life they had lived.  How
I wish I had written down these stories as they
were told to me.  But maybe they wouldn't have
"written," for much of the interest lay in the
personality of the story-teller.
</p>

<p>
McLeod's part was usually to help with dates
or names when Donaldson's memory failed to
recall them, but often he too would spin a yarn,
and when he did there was always in its telling
a gentleness, I can think of no better word, that
gave a charm often missing in Donaldson's
rougher style.
</p>

<p>
They were both big men physically, but McLeod
had been magnificent.  He was now nearly
eighty years old and broken with rheumatism,
but in the giant frame and noble face and head
crowned with its snow-white hair I saw my
ideal of what a great Highland Chieftain might
have been in the brave days of old.
</p>

<p>
Donaldson told me one night, while his
partner was making a batch of bread in his own
cabin, what he knew of McLeod's history.  "I
have never known a man," he said, "that would
measure up to my partner.  None of us want
our record searched too closely but it wouldn't
make any difference to him.  Nothing, nobody,
seemed to have any power to make Mac do
anything crooked or dirty.  Whisky, gambling,
bad women&mdash;he passed them up without
apparent effort.  Very strange too, even the few
good women we have met in these camps never
won anything from him but wholesome admiration.
He had only to say the word and he could
have had any one of them, but he didn't seem
to care that way.  What his experience had
been before we met I do not know, he has never
spoken much about it to anyone.  But he and I
have lived together as partners for nearly half
a century, through the crazy, wicked days of all
these gold camps, and Mac never did anything
that he would be ashamed to tell his own
mother."
</p>

<p>
A fine tribute.  Perhaps under the circumstances
the finest thing that could be said of any
man, for you cannot imagine the thousand
almost irresistible temptations that were part of
the daily life of the stampeders in those northern
camps.  Enough for me to say that many men of
really good character back East, where they were
unconsciously propped up by influences of
family, church, and community, failed miserably
to keep their footing when they came to the far
north where all these supports were absent and
temptation was everywhere.  I do not judge
them.  God only knows the fight they had
before they surrendered.  So it was an arresting
event to meet a man who had seen it all and
whose partner of forty years told me he had
lived clean.
</p>

<p>
I often wondered what McLeod's story was.
I had known him for three years before I
ventured to ask him details about his home in
Scotland, and why he left it to come so far away.
I knew he had been reared in a village south of
Edinburgh, in a good home with good parents,
and much else he had told me, but there had
always been a reticence that made you certain
there was something else held back.
</p>

<p>
One winter night when we were alone in his
cabin, he opened his heart to me.  He was an
old-fashioned Scot.  I was his "minister" and he
knew me well.  Besides he was coming to the
end of the trail, and he needed a confidant.
</p>

<p>
He said his story was hardly worth while
bothering me with, I knew most of it, but what
he could never tell anyone was about the lassie
he had loved and lost.  He had fallen in love
with the brown eyes and winsome face of
Margaret Campbell, a neighbour's daughter.
They had gone to the same school, had taken
their first communion together, and had both
sung in the village church choir.  When he
revealed his love to her she told him she had
guessed his secret and had lang syne given her heart
to him.  They were betrothed and very happy.
But Margaret took ill in the fall and died before
the new year.  Early in the year he sailed from
Leith for Canada, hoping that new scenes would
soften his grief.  As the years passed he kept
moving west and then north.  He grew to like
the free life of the prospector and had not
cared to leave the mountains and the trails.
</p>

<p>
Time had healed the wound but his love for
the sweetheart of his youth was just as true and
tender as ever.  From a hidden niche at the
head of his bed he took down a small box,
brought it to the table near the candle and
unlocked it.  He showed me his simple treasures.
His rough, calloused hands trembled as he lifted
them carefully from the box.  There was a small
photo so faded I could barely see the face on it.
"You'll see she was very beautiful," he said, for
he saw with the clear vision of loving memory
what was not for my younger but duller eyes to
discern.  There was her gold locket with a wisp
of brown hair in it.  "She left me this," he said,
"when she died."  Last, there was an old letter,
stained and worn, the only love-letter she had
ever written him, for he had only once been
far enough or long enough away to need letters.
He had spent a week in Glasgow after they
became engaged and she had written to him.
This was all.
</p>

<p>
Somehow I felt as if I were on sacred ground,
that the curtain had been drawn from before
a Holy Place, and I was looking upon something
more beautiful than I had ever seen before.  As
the old man put the box away his eyes were
shining "with a light that never was on sea or
land."  Mine were moist, and for a little I
couldn't trust my voice to speak as I thought
of the life-time of unswerving fealty to his dead
lassie.  Such long, lonely years they must have
been!
</p>

<p>
We did not say much more that night but the
words we spoke were full of understanding and
reverence.  When it grew late and he handed
me the Bible I hesitated in choosing a chapter,
but not for long.  The comfort and rejoicing of
the twenty-third Psalm were all we wanted.
</p>

<p>
One morning, not long afterwards, Donaldson
came into my cabin on Hunker creek in evident
distress.  McLeod hadn't come out as usual
to his work that morning, and he had gone to
see what was wrong and found him in his bunk
hardly able to speak.  He had taken "a stroke."  A
neighbouring miner watched by the sick man
while Donaldson hitched up his dogs and raced
to Dawson for medical aid.  Donaldson went
off down the trail and I hurried up the gulch to
my old friend.  He lingered for two or three
days.  The doctor could do nothing for him but
to ease his last moments.
</p>

<p>
I stayed near him until the end came.  When
he tried to speak his utterance was indistinct
and what few words I could make out showed
that his mind was wandering.  Sometimes he
was on the trail or in the camp, but oftenest he
was home again in the far away land he loved,
and in boyhood days among folk we did not
know save one, known only to me, whose name
was continually on his lips.
</p>

<p>
He had a lucid interval just before he died
and for a minute or two he thought and spoke
clearly.  I told him that death was near.  Was
there anything that we could do for him?  "Not
very much," he said, "I want Donaldson to have
all I own.  He's been a good partner.  Bury
my box with me.  I'm not afraid to go now.  It's
just another prospecting trip to an unknown land
and I have a Great Guide.  He won't forsake
an old prospector.  He was one Himself, I'm
thinking, when He came seeking us.  He will
keep a firm grip of me now that the trail is
growing dark.  I'm not afraid."
</p>

<p>
These were his last words, and as he slipped
away, we, who were gathered in the dimly-lighted
little cabin, felt somehow that the Guide he
spoke of was right at hand.  He would surely
keep "a firm grip" of the old miner on his
last prospecting trip, even if strange storms
were blowing, and it was black dark when they
crossed the Great Divide.  It would come
morning too in that land when night was past, and
when the new day dawned I know he would
soon find the one whom he had "loved long since
and lost awhile."

<i>XVI.</i>
<br /><br />
<i>Soapy Smith, the Skagway Bandit</i>
</h3>

<p>
My billet on the hospital ship <i>Araguaya</i>
was very comfortable and my duties
agreeable, but every time we reached port on
the Canadian side of the Atlantic I had an
impulse to desert the ship and become a
stowaway on the hospital-train bound for British
Columbia.  It was there my wife and boy lived
and I hadn't seen them for three years.  However
I got the chance at last to go without breaking
regulations, for when I requested it, leave
was readily granted me to stay ashore over one
round-trip of the boat.  This was supplemented
by my taking the place of an absent conducting
officer on the western train.  So my transportation
cost me nothing, except the congenial task
of making myself generally useful to the
returning soldiers.
</p>

<p>
We had crossed the prairies, dropping many
of our crowd at way points, and were climbing
slowly along after supper up through a lonely
stretch of mountains, when someone in the car
where I was "visiting" gave it as his opinion
that this would be a good piece of road on which
to stage a train-robbery.  This, of course, led to
the mention of gun-men that they had known
or heard of, men of the same ilk as Jesse James
and Bill Miner.  I contributed the story of
Soapy Smith, the man who pulled off the most
remarkably prolonged hold-up of which I have
ever read.  In the most approved dime-novel
style he terrorized a town, not for a few days
or weeks, but for six months.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to see the spot where Soapy
died."  The Skagway man who said this was rather
proud of the celebrity which the bandit had
brought to the place.  I had come by the
steamboat the nine hundred miles north from
Vancouver, and was forced to spend a day in
Skagway before going over the White Pass on my way
to Dawson.  A resident of the town was taking
me around showing me the sights of this
mushroom camp.  It was humming with life and
packed with people.  The rush to the goldfields
was then at its height.  I judged by my friend's
tone that he expected me to be deeply impressed
with this particular sight.  So down to the sea
we went and out on the wharf.  As we walked
down he outlined the story of Smith's career in
the camp.  On the pier he showed me a dark
stain, covering about a square foot, made by the
life-blood of the man who for half-a-year forced
Skagway to pay him tribute in hard cash.  He
was the leader of a group of men who robbed
and cheated in wholesale style, and when it was
necessary, in getting their victim's money, did
not stop at murder.  No one had attempted
successfully to interfere with him.  Reputable
merchants were all intimidated into handing him
their "life-insurance premiums" whenever he
asked for them.  His reputation as a "killer"
was such that on the fourth of July, when good
Americans celebrate their freedom, he rode at
the head of the procession on a white horse!
Very few complained loudly enough for Soapy
to hear.  Without question his nerve is to be
admired.  I have never heard or read in the annals
of the west anything to equal his record in that
Alaskan port.  Desperadoes have ridden into
towns, "shot them up," took what they wanted
and got away with it.  But this man and his
gang lived openly in a town of several
thousands and in the most brazen fashion ran the
place for months, although he was known as a
crook, gunman, and leader of a gang of thugs.
Skagway, it is true, was simply an eddy in a
stream running into the gold-fields.  In their
mad haste to get on and over the Pass people
wouldn't take time to straighten out the morals
of the camp.  The Soapy Smith business was
especially uninviting as something to mix into.
"It isn't my funeral," they would say, "and I
don't want it to be."
</p>

<p>
Jefferson B. Smith hailed from the city of
St. Louis in the U.S.A.  He got the nickname he
bore because at the beginning of his career of
crookedness he used to sell soap to some of the
citizens of Denver, Colorado.  There is nothing
remarkable about selling soap unless you do it
Smith's way.  In the evenings he and a
confederate would set up their "stand" on a
suitable downtown street.  All he needed was a high
box for a "pulpit" and a smaller box behind it
to stand on.  This with a flaring torch giving
an uneven light, some cakes of cheap soap, a
couple of five-dollar bills and some change,
completed the outfit.  A little clever "spieling,"
kept up more or less all evening, and the usual
crowd would gather out of curiosity.  He would
show them an unwrapped piece of soap all the
while extolling its great merits as a cleanser.  To
show how disinterested he was in introducing
this superior article that only needed to be known
to become popular, he would say he was going
to wrap a five-dollar-bill in with some of these
cakes of soap.  He would sell the soap at fifty
cents each piece, and everyone that bought stood
to get the soap and make four dollars and fifty
cents in cash out of the deal.  Further if they
watched him carefully they would see him
actually put the five-dollar bill in when he wrapped
up the soap, although he wouldn't guarantee
that it would always be found there when the
purchaser unwrapped his package.  Of course
he deceived them simply by clever sleight-of-hand.
Rarely would any money be found, but
people liked to be fooled if it is done the right
way.  To get them "biting" he might let one
of the bills go to a confederate who was
seemingly just one of the crowd.  It was a
money-making business as a rule for there were
ordinarily quite a number of "easy-marks"
around.  They got the soap anyway.  So came
the name "Soapy."
</p>

<p>
Well, it was the same old clever, crooked game
in other bigger and bolder forms that he now
worked in Skagway, with the gun-play in
addition.  When the steamboat City of Seattle came
into port there on January 17th, 1898, Soapy
and his "merrie-men" were among the passengers.
He was a slight built man, only five feet
seven inches tall, very dark complexioned with
a full beard and moustache.  He wore a round
Stetson hat with a hard brim.  He soon
established headquarters in the "Kentucky saloon"
and "Jeff Smith's Parlors."  These were liquor
saloons, not providing board or lodging, and
running crooked gambling games in their rear,
a fruitful source of revenue to Smith's
card-sharpers.  Then he and his confederates got
busy on all sorts of other schemes to steal people's
money.  He had at least thirty followers, and
there wasn't a dishonest trick known to the
underworld of those days that some of them
couldn't work.  They wore Masonic, Oddfellow,
Elk and other fraternity emblems that might
help in working "confidence-games."  They
opened up Information Bureaus where
newcomers could be conveniently sized-up and
robbed then or later on.  One member who was
very successful in luring victims was Old Man
Tripp.  He had grey hair, a long white beard
and a benevolent countenance.  It seemed
impossible to suspect him of criminal intent.  Smith
had most of the gambling-joints paying him a
big percentage.  He even had men clever at the
old, old "shell-game" running it in the fine
weather at relay points on the trail.
</p>

<p>
One of his favorite stunts for a while at first
was to recruit for the Spanish-American war
which was just then stirring the fighting blood
of Americans.  While the would-be soldier was
stripped, having a fake medical examination,
his clothing was looted of whatever money or
valuables it might contain.
</p>

<p>
A rather amusing incident occurred during
Smith's regime in connection with the efforts
of a Sky Pilot to raise some money at Skagway
to build a church in a little place along the
coast called Dyea.  The parson came to
Skagway in a rowboat one morning and started out
with his subscription list.  One of the first he
tackled by chance and unknown to himself was
the notorious bandit.  Smith heartily endorsed
the proposition and headed the list with one
hundred dollars which he paid over in cash to
the clergyman.  Then he took the latter
gentleman along to the principal merchants,
hotel-men and gamblers and saw to it that they all
gave handsome donations.  At the close of the
day the visitor decided to make for home.  He
was happy in the possession of over $2,000 in
cash for his new church, thinking too what a
splendid fellow this Mr. Smith was.  On the
way to the beach he was "held up" by one of
Mr. Smith's lieutenants and relieved of all the money
he had collected.  He could get no redress.
</p>

<p>
Other occurrences, such as the smothering of
the negro-wench in order to steal the few
hundred dollars she had earned by washing, were
despicable and worthy only of the meanest type
of criminal.
</p>

<p>
Naturally there were many shooting scrapes in
connection with the operations of the gang, and
some killings, but nothing was done to end it.
Not only was no move made to interfere with
Soapy, but almost everyone refrained from
speaking against him openly for reasons easy
to understand.  Of course there were men in
Skagway who hotly resented the hold this
outlaw had on the town, and were doing what they
could to bring public sentiment to efficient action
against him.  One of these, a Canadian, was the
editor of a local news sheet.  In later years he
became governor of Alaska.  His name was
Strong and it suited him, for he wasn't lacking
in strength of character.  One day, after his
paper had appeared with an editorial making a
scarcely-veiled attack on Soapy and his gang, he
was met and stopped on the street by Smith
accompanied by a tough named Mike Daley.
They were loud and boisterous in accusing
Strong of having offered personal insult to them
in his newspaper.  They demanded a retraction
and apology and evidently meant to force a
street-fight.  Strong refused to withdraw his
statement and declared that he intended to stand
by his editorial.  The loud quarrelling tones of
the two desperadoes attracted the attention of
two friends of Strong's, named D. C. Stephens
and Allen, who happened to be walking down
the same street.  They hurried to the aid of their
friend who at the risk of his life still refused
to back down.  The sight of reinforcements
spoiled Smith's game and he and Daley went
on without accomplishing their sinister purpose.

There was another man who did not hesitate
to say anywhere, and in most forcible terms what
he thought of these criminals.  This man was
Frank Reid, a land-surveyor.  He was fearless,
and too quick with a gun for these crooks to
attempt to silence.  But he got very little open
support and could do nothing single-handed.
</p>

<p>
Of course things couldn't go on like this.  In
the Spring matters reached a climax.  Word had
at last got into the Klondike that it wasn't safe
to come out by way of Skagway with your gold,
that you were likely to be relieved of your "poke"
by desperadoes.  This news commenced to turn
out-going gold-laden traffic down the Yukon and
out by way of St. Michaels.  The Skagway
merchants saw "the goose that laid the golden
eggs" flying away, and it put them at last into
a ferment of anger at the cause of it.  This led
to the formation of a Vigilance Committee of
which Reid was the moving spirit.
</p>

<p>
Finally a Nanaimo man named Stewart,
waiting for the steamboat on his way home from
the Klondike, had $3,000.00 in nuggets stolen
from him by one of Soapy's confidence men
who had offered to turn it into currency.  It
was all he had and he made such a fuss that
the whole town knew about his loss.  He
reported it to the U.S. Deputy-Marshal, a man
named Taylor who was in Smith's pay.  He
got no satisfaction.  The Vigilance Committee
then took it up, and made it a "casus belli"
against Soapy.  They attempted to hold a secret
meeting in a private hall but Smith and his
confederates managed to break in on them.  They
then adjourned to Sylvester's wharf.  At the
land-end of the pier Frank Reid and a man
named Murphy were posted to stop anyone
approaching who was not a member of the
Committee.  Smith heard of this move and set off
on the war-path down the main street towards
the water-front.  He carried a loaded .30-.30
Winchester rifle and as he went down the road
he called on everyone to put up their hands.
There were hundreds of men there but Soapy
got a completely unanimous "vote" as he passed
along, until he reached Reid and in him he met
a man who called his bluff.  Reid ordered him
to stop and fired at him, but his revolver, a .45
Colt, failed to go off.  He then grabbed the
muzzle of Smith's gun and shoved it up in the
air before he could shoot.  Smith in the struggle
backed away hanging on to his rifle, and while
the gun was thus lowered and pointed
momentarily at Reid's groin he fired.  Reid fell to
the ground but instantly fired at Smith again.
This time the revolver responded and Smith
dropped shot through the heart.  He bled to
death in a few minutes where he lay.  This was
the evening of July 8th, three days after the
celebration already mentioned in which the
gunman had taken the leading part.  So the wharf
was stained, and so ended the life of a man with
a career of which the last six months were
unique in the history of the wild west.
</p>

<p>
Their leader gone, the break-up of his
followers was quick and easy.  After caring for
Reid the Committee split up into armed groups
of five or six men each.  Some guarded the exits
from the town, others closed the dance-halls,
saloons, and gambling places.  Every cabin was
searched.  Smith was killed on Friday and by
Sunday the lot were rounded up and jailed.
The captures included the five most dangerous
members of the gang, Old Man Tripp, Slim
Jim, Bowers, Mike Daly, and Scar-faced
Charlie.  It was indeed hard for any of them to
escape.  In front was the sea and behind the
mountains with only one passable trail through
them over into the Yukon Territory.  They
were all deported on out-going steamers.  Most
of them got long terms in penetentiary.
Before the shooting a few of them who saw danger
ahead straggled over into Canada by way of the
White Pass but they changed into "model
citizens" when they came under the surveillance of
the Mounted Police.
</p>

<p>
Smith was buried with scant ceremony and no
mourners.  Frank Reid lingered for two weeks
when he also died.  The whole place turned out
at his funeral to do honor to his bravery in
ridding the town of the pestilential group of
criminals who had been in control so long.
